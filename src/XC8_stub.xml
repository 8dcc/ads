<introduction><p>This is a stub for Part 2 of Applied Discrete Stuctures. To see the whole chapter, visit our web page at http://faculty.uml.edu/klevasseur/ADS2.</p><p>An essential tool that anyone interested in computer science must master is how to think recursively. The ability to understand definitions, concepts,
algorithms, etc., that are presented recursively and the ability to put thoughts into a recursive framework are essential in computer science. One of our goals in this chapter is to help the reader become more comfortable with recursion in its commonly encountered forms.</p>
<p>A second goal is to discuss recurrence relations. We will concentrate on methods of solving recurrence relations, including an introduction to generating
functions.
