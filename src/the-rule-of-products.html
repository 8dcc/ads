 One of the first concepts our parents taught us was the “art of counting.” We were taught to raise three fingers to indicate that we were three years old. The question of “how many” is a natural and frequently asked question. Combinatorics is the “art of counting.” It is the study of techniques that will help us to count the number of objects in a set quickly. Highly sophisticated results can be obtained with this simple concept. The following examples will illustrate that many questions concerned with counting involve the same process.

 FIGURE 2.1.1 Tree solution for Example 2.1.1
</p>
<p>
 Every path that begins at the position labeled START and goes to the right can be interpreted as a choice of one of the five sandwiches followed by a choice of one of the three beverages. Note that considerable work is required to arrive at the number fifteen this way; but we also get more than just a number. The result is a complete list of all possible lunches. If we need to answer a question that starts with “How many . . . ,” enumeration would be done only as a last resort. In a later chapter we will examine more enumeration techniques.
</p>
<p>
 An alternative method of solution for this example is to make the simple observation that there are five different choices for sandwiches and three different choices for beverages, so there are \(5 \cdot 3 = 15\) different lunches that can be ordered.
</p>
<p>
 A listing of possible lunches a person could have is: {(BEEF, milk), (BEEF, juice), (BEEF, coffee), ..., (BOLOGNA, coffee)}.

Since the first entry of each pair can be any one of the five elements \(a, b, c, d\), and \(e\), and since the second can be any one of the three numbers 1, 2, and 3, it is quite clear there are 
\(5 \cdot 3 = 15\) different elements in \(A \times B\).

</p>
<p>
Note: It is important that \(p_2\) does not depend on the option that is chosen in the first operation. Another way of saying this is that \(p_2\) is independent of the first operation. If \(p_2\) is dependent on the first operation, then the rule of products does not apply.

 In Chapter 1 we introduced the power set of a set A, P(A), which is the set of all subsets of A. Can we predict how many elements are in \(\mathcal{P}(A)\) for a given finite set A? The answer is yes, and in fact if \(|A| = n\), then \(\mathcal{P}(A) = 2^{n}\).  The ease with which we can prove this fact demonstrates the power and usefulness of the rule of products. Do not underestimate the usefulness of simple ideas.

Proof: Consider how we might determine any \(B \in \mathcal{P}(A)\), where \( |A|=n\). For each element \(x \in A\) there are two choices, either \(x \in B\) or \(x \notin B\).  Since there are \(n\)  elements of \(A\)  we have, by the rule of products,
