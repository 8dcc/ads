<p>Let \(B_1\) and \(B_2\) be subsets of a set <m>A</m>. Notice that the Venn diagram of <xref ref="fig-minsets-2" autoname="yes" /> is naturally partitioned into the subsets \(A_1\), \(A_2\), \(A_3\), and \(A_4\). Further we observe that \(A_1\), \(A_2\), \(A_3\), and \(A_4\) can be described in terms of \(B_1\) and \(B_2\) as follows:</p>

<p>Each \(A_i\) is called a minset generated by \(B_1\) and \(B_2\) . We note that each minset is formed by taking the intersection of two sets where each may be either \(B_k\) or its complement, \(B_k^c\) / Note also, given two sets, there are \(2^{2}=4\) minsets.</p>
<p>Minsets are occasionally called <em>minterms</em>.</p>
<p>The reader should note that if we apply all possible combinations of the operations intersection, union, and complementation to the sets \(B_1\) and \(B_2\) of Figure 4.3.1, the smallest sets generated will be exactly the minsets, the minimum sets. Hence the derivation of the term minset.</p>
<p>Next consider the Venn diagram containing three sets, \(B_1\), \(B_2\), and \(B_3\). Draw it right now and count the regions! 
What are the minsets generated by \(B_1\), \(B_2\), and \(B_3\)? How many are there? Following the procedures outlined above, we note that</p>

<p>are three of the \(2^3=8\) minsets. What are the others?</p>

<definition xml:id="def-Minset"><title>Minset</title>
<statement> Let \(\{B_1, B_2,\ldots,B_n\}\) be a set of subsets of  set <m>A</m>. Sets of the form \(D_1\cap D_2\cap
\cdots \cap D_n\), where each \(D_i\), may be either \(B_i\) or \(B_i^c\) is called a minset generated by \(B_1\), \(B_2\),... and  \(B_n\).</statement></definition>
<example xml:id="ex-minset-example"><title>A concrete example of some minsets</title><p>Consider the following concrete example. Let \(A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\) with subsets \(B_1 = \{1,3,5\}\) and \(B_2= \{1,2,3\}\). How can we use set operations applied to \(B_1\) and \(B_2\) and produce a list of sets that contain elements of <m>A</m> efficiently
without duplication? As a first attempt, we might try</p>
<table xml:id="tab-subsets-generated-1">
<tabular top="none" halign="center">
<row><cell>\(B_1\cap B_2=\{1,3\}\)</cell></row>
<row><cell>\(B_1^c=\{2,4,6\}\), and</cell></row>
<row><cell>\(B_2^c=\{4,5,6\}\).</cell></row>
</tabular>
</table>

<p>We have produced all elements of A but we have 4 and 6 repeated in two sets. In place of \(B_1^c\) and \(B_2^c\), let's try \(B_1^c\cap B_2\) and \(B_1\cap B_2^c\), respectively:</p>
<table xml:id="tab-subsets-generated-2">
<tabular top="none" halign="center">
<row><cell>\(B_1^c\cap B_2=\{2\}\) and</cell></row>
<row><cell>\(B_1\cap B_2^c=\{5\}\).</cell></row>
</tabular>
</table>
<p>We have now produced the elements 1, 2, 3, and 5 using \(B_1\cap B_2\) ,  \(B_1^c\cap B_2\) and \(B_1\cap B_2^c\) yet we have not listed the elements 4 and 6. Most ways that we could combine \(B_1\) and \(B_2\) such as \(B_1\cup B_2\) or \(B_1\cup B_2^c\) will produce duplications of listed
elements and will not produce both 4 and 6. However we note that \(B_1^c\cap B_2^c= \{4, 6\}\), exactly the elements we need.  Each element of <m>A</m> appears exactly once in one of the four minsets \(B_1\cap B_2\) ,  \(B_1^c\cap B_2\), \(B_1\cap B_2^c\) and \(B_1^c\cap B_2^c\). Hence, we have a partition of <m>A</m>.</p>
</example>
<theorem xml:id="th-minset-partition"><title>Minset Partition Theorem</title><statement><p> Let <m>A</m> be a set and let \(B_1\), \(B_2\) \(\ldots\)  , \(B_n\) be subsets of <m>A</m>. The set of nonempty minsets generated by  \(B_1\), \(B_2\) \(\ldots\)  , \(B_n\) is a partition of <m>A</m>.</p>
</statement><proof>The proof of this theorem is left to the reader.</proof></theorem>
<p>One of the most significant fact about minsets is that any subset of <m>A</m> that can be obtained
from  \(B_1\), \(B_2\) \(\ldots\)  , \(B_n\), using the standard set operations can be obtained in a standard form by taking the union of selected minsets.</p>
<definition xml:id="def-minset-normal-form"><title>Minset Normal Form</title><statement><p>A set is said to be in minset normal 
form when it is expressed as the union of zero or more distinct nonempty minsets.</p></statement></definition>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li> The union of zero sets is the empty set, \emptyset .</li>
<li> Minset normal form is also called <em>canonical form</em>.</li>
</ul>
<example xml:id="ex-concrete-minsets-2"><title>Another Concrete Example of Minsets</title><p> Let \(U = \{-2,-1,0,1,2\}\), \(B_1= \{0,1,2\}\), and \(B_2= \{0,2\}\).  Then</p>
<table>
<tabular top="none" halign="center">
<row><item>\(B_1\cap B_2=\{0,2\}\) </item></row> 
<row><item>\(B_1^c\cap B_2 = \emptyset\) </item></row> 
<row><item>\(B_1\cap B_2^c = \{1\}\) </item></row> 
<row><item>\(B_1^c\cap B_2^c = \{-2,-1\}\) </item></row> 
</tabular>
</table>
<p>In this case, there are only three nonempty minsets, producing the partition \(\{\{0,2\},\{1\},\{-2,-1\}\}\). An example of a set that could not be produced from just \(B_1\) and \(B_2\) is the set of even elements of <m>U</m>, \(\{-2,0,2\}\). This is because -2 and -1 cannot be separated - they are in the same minset and any union of minsets either includes or excludes them both.  In general, there are \(2^3= 8\) different minset normal forms because there are three nonempty minsets. This means that only 8 of the \(2^5=32\) subsets of <m>U</m> could be generated from  any two sets \(B_1\) and \(B_2\). </p>
