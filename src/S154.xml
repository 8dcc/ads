<index><main>Normal Subgroups and Group Homomorphisms</main></index>



Our goal in this section is to answer an open question and introduce a related concept. The question is: When are left cosets of a subgroup a group
under the induced operation? This question is open for non-abelian groups. Now that we have some examples to work with, we can try a few experiments.



<subsection xml:id="ss-NORMAL SUBGROUPS"><title>NORMAL SUBGROUPS</title><index><main>NORMAL SUBGROUPS</main></index>

<example xml:id="ex-15.4.1"><title>15.4.1</title><p></p></example>  \(A_3= \left\{i,r_1,r_2\right\}\) is a subgroup of \(S_3\), and its left cosets are \(A_3\) itself and \(B_3=\left\{f_1,f_2,f_3\right\}\)
. Whether \(\left\{A_3 , B_3 \right\}\) is a group boils down to determining whether the induced operation is well defined.   Consider the operation
table for \(S_3\)in Figure 15.4.1.

\includegraphics{C15b_gr1.eps}


\caption{\pmb{ Figure 15.4.1\\
Shaded operation table for }\pmb{ \(S_3\)}}

We have shaded in all occurrences of the elements of \(B_3\) in gray. We will call these elements the gray elements and the elements of \(A_3\) the
white ones.

Now consider the process of computing the coset product \(A_3\circ B_3\). The  <q>product</q> is obtained by selecting one white element and one
gray element. Note that white <q>times</q> gray is always gray. Thus, \(A_3\circ B_3\) is well defined. Similarly, the other three possible products
are well defined. The table for the factor group \(S_3/A_3\) is

   \(\begin{array}{c|c}
 \circ  &amp; 
\begin{array}{cc}
 A_3 &amp; B_3 \\
\end{array}
 \\
\hline
 
\begin{array}{c}
 A_{3 } \\
 B_3 \\
\end{array}
 &amp; 
\begin{array}{cc}
 A_3 &amp; B_3 \\
 B_3 &amp; A_3 \\
\end{array}
 \\
\end{array}\)

Clearly, \(S_3/A_3\) is isomorphic toe \(\mathbb{Z}_2\).   Note that \(A_3\) and \(B_3\) are also the right cosets of \(A_3\).  This is significant.

<example xml:id="ex-15.4.2."><title>15.4.2.</title><p></p></example> Now let's try the left cosets of \(\left\langle f_1\right\rangle\) in \(S_3\). There are three of them. Will we get a complicated
version of \(\mathbb{Z}_3\) ? The left cosets are

 \(C_0=\left\langle f_1\right\rangle\), \(C_1= r_1\left\langle f_1\right\rangle = \left\{r_1,f_3\right\}\),  and \(C_2= r_2\left\langle
f_1\right\rangle = \left\{r_2,f_2\right\}\)

The reader might be expecting something to go wrong eventually, and here it is. To determine \(C_1\circ C_2\) we can choose from four pairs of representatives:

\(r_1\in C_1\), \(r_2\in C_2\)    \(\longrightarrow \text r_1\circ r_2=i\in C_0\)

\(r_1\in C_1\), \(f_2\in C_2\)    \(\longrightarrow \text r_1\circ f_2=f\in C_0\)

\(f_3\in C_1\), \(r_2\in C_2\)    \(\longrightarrow \text f_3\circ r_2=f_2\in C_2\)

\(f_3\in C_1\), \(f_2\in C_2\)    \(\longrightarrow \text f_3\circ f_2=r_2\in C_2\)

This time, we don't get the same coset for each pair of representatives. Therefore, the induced operation is not well defined and no factor group
is obtained.



Commentary: This last development changes our course of action. If we had gotten a factor group from \(\left\{C_0,C_1,C_2\right\}\), we might have
hoped to prove that every collection of left cosets forms a group. Now our question is: How can we determine whether we will get a factor group?
Of course, this question is equivalent to: When is the induced operation well defined? There was only one step in the proof of Theorem 15.2.3, where
we used the fact that <m>G</m> was abelian. We repeat the equations here:



\(a'*b' = \left(a*h_1\right)*\left(b*h_2 \right) = (a*b)*\left(h_1*h_2\right)\),



since <m>G</m> was abelian.



The last step was made possible by the fact that \(h_1*b=b*h_1\). As the proof continued, we used the fact that \(h_1*h_2\) was in <m>H</m> and
so \(a'*b'\) is \((a*b)*h\) for some <m>h</m> in <m>H</m>. All that we really needed in the <q>abelian step</q> was that



\(h_1*b = b*(\textrm{ something} \textrm{ in} H) = b*h_3\) .



Then, since <m>H</m> is closed under <m>G</m>'s operation, \(h_3*h_2\) is an element of <m>H</m>. The consequence of this observation is
included in the following theorem, the proof of which can be found in any abstract algebra text.

<theorem xml:id="theorem-15.4.1."><title>15.4.1.</title><index><main>15.4.1.</main></index><statement></statement><proof></proof></theorem>  If \(H \leq G\), then the operation induced on left cosets of <m>H</m> by the operation of <m>G</m> is well defined
if and only if  any one of the following conditions is true:<ol label="a">
<li><p> If \(h \in  H\), \(a \in  G\), then there exists \(h' \in  H\) such that \(h*a = a*h'\).

(b) If \(h \in H\), \(a \in G\), then \(a^{-1}*h*a \in  H\).

(c) Every left coset of <m>H</m> is equal to a right coset of <m>H</m>.

\pmb{ Corollary 15.4.2. }   If \(H \leq G\), then the operation induced on left cosets of <m>H</m> by the operation of <m>G</m> is well defined
if either of the following two conditions is true.<ol label="a">
<li><p><m>G</m> is abelian.

(b) \(\left| H\right|  = \frac{\left| G\right| }{2}\).

<example xml:id="ex-15.4.3."><title>15.4.3.</title><p></p></example> The right cosets of \(\left\langle f_1\right\rangle \leq  S_3\) are \(\left\{i, f_1\right\}\), \(\left\{r_1 f_2 \right\}\),
and \(\left\{r_2 ,f_3\right\}\). These are not the same as the left cosets of \(\left\langle f_1\right\rangle\). In addition, \(f_2{}^{-1}f_1f_2=f_2f_1f_2=f_3\notin
\left\langle f_1\right\rangle\).

 If G is a group, \(H \leq  G\), then H is called a normal subgroup of  G, denoted \(H \triangleleft  G\), if
it satisfies any of the conditions of Theorem 15.4.1.

<example xml:id="ex-15.4.4."><title>15.4.4.</title><p></p></example> The improper subgroups \(\{e\}\) and <m>G</m> of any group <m>G</m> are normal subgroups.  \(G/\{e\}\) is isomorphic
to <m>G</m>.  All other normal subgroups of a group, if they exist are called proper normal subgroups.. 

<example xml:id="ex-15.4.5."><title>15.4.5.</title><p></p></example> By Condition b of Corollary 15.4.2, \(A_n\) is a normal subgroup of \(S_n\) and \(S_n/A_n\)  is isomorphic
to \(\mathbb{Z}_2\).

<example xml:id="ex-15.4.6."><title>15.4.6.</title><p></p></example>  \(A_5\), a group in its own right with 60 elements, has many proper subgroups, but none are normal. Although this could
be done by brute force, the number of elements in the group would make the process tedious.  A far more elegant way to approach the verification
of this statement is to use the following fact about the cycle structure of permutations.    If \(f\in S_n\) is a permutation with a certain
cycle structure,  \(\sigma _1\sigma _2\cdots \sigma _k\), where the length of \(\sigma _i\) is \(\ell _i\), then for any \(g\in S_n\),   \(g^{-1}\circ
f\circ g\) , which is the conjugate of f by g, .  will have a cycle structure with exactly the same cycle lengths.   For example if we
take \(f=(1,2,3,4)(5,6)(7,8,9)\in S_9\) and conjugate by \(g=(1,3,5,7,9)\),

\(\textrm{              }g^{-1}\circ f\circ g=(1,9,7,5,3)\circ (1,2,3,4)(5,6)(7,8,9)\circ (1,3,5,7,9)\quad \quad = (1,4,9,2)(3,6)(5,8,7)\)



Notice that the condition for normality of a subgroup H . of <m>G</m> is that the conjugate of any element of H .  by an element
of <m>G</m> must be remain in <m>H</m>.   

To verify that \(A_5\) has no proper normal subgroups, you can start by cataloging the different cycle structures that occur in \(A_5\) and how many
elements have those structures.   Then consider what happens when you conjugate these different cycle structures with elements of \(A_5\).  
An outline of the process is in the exercises.

<example xml:id="ex-15.4.7."><title>15.4.7.</title><p></p></example>  Let G be the set of two by two invertible matrices of real numbers.  That is,

\(G=\left\{\left.\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
 a &amp; b \\
 c &amp; d \\
\end{array}
\right)\right| a,b,c,d\in \mathbb{R}, a d-b c\neq  0\right\}\)

We saw in Chapter 11 that <m>G</m> is a group with matrix multiplication.

\(H_1=\left\{\left.\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
 a &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; a \\
\end{array}
\right)\right| a \neq 0\right\}\)   and \(H_2=\left\{\left.\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
 a &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; d \\
\end{array}
\right)\right| a d \neq 0\right\}\)

are both subgroups of G.   . \(H_1\) a normal subgroup of G, . while \(H_2\) is not normal.



<subsubsection xml:id="sss-Homomorphisms"><title>Homomorphisms</title><index><main>Homomorphisms</main></index>



Think of the word isomorphism. . Chances are, one of the first images that comes to mind is an equation something like



 \(\theta (x * y) = \theta (x) \diamond  \theta (y)\)  $\quad \quad $(H)



An isomorphism must be a bijection, but equation (H) is the algebraic feature of an isomorphism. Here we will examine functions that satisfy equations
of this type.



Many homomorphisms are useful since they point out similarities between the two groups (or, on the universal level, two algebraic systems) involved.



Consider the groups \(\left[\mathbb{R}^3 , +\right]\) and \(\left[\mathbb{R}^2,+\right]\). Every time you use a camera, you are trying to transfer
the essence of something three-dimensional onto a photograph$---$that is, something two-dimensional.  If you show a friend a photo you have taken,
that person can appreciate much of what you saw, even though a dimension is lacking. The <q>picture-taking</q> map is a function \(f : \mathbb{R}^3
\to  \mathbb{R}^2\) defined by \(f\left(x_1, x_2 , x_3 \right) = \left(x_1,x_2\right)\). This function is not a bijection, but it does satisfy the
equation \(f(x + y) =f(x) + f(y)\) for \(x = \left(x_1,x_2,x_3\right)\) and \(y = \left(y_1,y_2,y_3\right)\). Such a function is called a homomorphism,
and when a homomorphism exists between two groups, the groups are called homomorphic that is, they are similar.  A question that arises with groups,
or other algebraic structures, that we claim are homomorphic, or similar, is: How similar are they? When we say that two groups are isomorphic$---$that
is, identical$---$the map that we use to prove this is unimportant. However, when we say that two groups are homomorphic, the map used gives us a
measure of the group's similarities (or dissimilarities). For example, the maps:



\(f_1: \mathbb{R}^3 \to  \mathbb{R}^3\) defined by \(f_1\left(x_1,x_2,x_3\right)=\left(x_1,x_2,x_3\right)\),



\(f_2 : \mathbb{R}^3 \to  \mathbb{R}^3\) defined by \(f_2\left(x_1,x_2,x_3\right)=\left(x_1,x_2,0\right)\), and



\(f_3 : \mathbb{R}^3 \to  \mathbb{R}^3\) defined by \(f_3\left(x_1,x_2,x_3\right)=(0,0,0)\)



are all homomorphisms. Think of them all as <q>picture-taking</q> maps, or cameras. The first camera gives us a three-dimensional picture, the ideal,
actually an isomorphism. The second gives us the usual two-dimensional picture, certainly something quite worthwhile. The third collapses the whole
scene onto a point, a <q>black dot,</q> which gives no idea of the original structure. Hence, the knowledge that two groups are homomorphic doesn{'}t
give complete information about the similarities in the structures of the two groups.  For this reason, the term homomorphic is rarely used (unlike
isomorphic), and the functions, the homomorphisms, are studied.



<definition xml:id="def-Homomorphism."><title>Homomorphism.</title><index><main>Homomorphism.</main></index><notation><usage></usage><description></description></notation><statement><p></p></statement></definition>

 Let \([G, *]\) and \([G',\diamond ]\) be groups. \(\theta :G\to G'\) is a homomorphism if \(\theta (x * y) = \theta
(x) \diamond  \theta (y)\) for all \(x, y \in G\).



<example xml:id="ex-15.4.8."><title>15.4.8.</title><p></p></example>  Define \(\alpha :\mathbb{Z}_6\to \mathbb{Z}_3\) by \(\alpha (n)=n(1)\), where \(n \in  \mathbb{Z}_6\) and \(n(1)\) is the
sum of <m>n</m> ones in \(\mathbb{Z}_3\). Therefore, \(\alpha (0) = 0\), \(\alpha (1) = 1\), \(\alpha (2) = 2\), \(\alpha (3) =1 + 1 + 1=0\),
\(\alpha (4) = 1\), and \(\alpha (5) = 2\). If \(n, m \in \mathbb{Z}_6\),



\(\textrm{          }\alpha \left(n +_6 m\right) = \left(n +_6 m\right)(1)\quad \quad =n(1)+_3m(1)\quad \quad =\alpha (n)+_3\alpha (m)\)



<theorem xml:id="theorem-15.4.2."><title>15.4.2.</title><index><main>15.4.2.</main></index><statement></statement><proof></proof></theorem> A few properties of homomorphisms are that if \(\theta : G \rightarrow  G'\) is a homomorphism, then:

<ol label="a">
<li><p>  \(\theta (e) = \theta (\textrm{ identity} \textrm{ of} G) = \textrm{ identity} \textrm{ of} G' = e'\).

</p></li>
<li><p>If \(H \leq  G\), then \(\theta (H) = \{\theta (h) | h\in H\}\leq G'\).



Proof:

<ol label="a">
<li><p>Let <m>a</m> be any element of <m>G</m>. Then \(\theta (a) \in  G'\).



\(\textrm{                }\theta (a)\diamond  e' = \theta (a)\textrm{                }\textrm{ by} \textrm{ the} \textrm{ definition} \textrm{ of} e'\textrm{ $\quad

By cancellation, \(e' = \theta (e)\).</p></li>
<li><p>Again, let \(a \in G\).



$\quad \quad $\(e' = \theta (e) = \theta \left(a*a^{-1} \right) = \theta (a)\diamond \theta \left(a^{-1}\right)\).



Hence, by the uniqueness of inverses,  \(\theta (a) ^{-1}= \theta \left(a^{-1}\right)\).</p></li>
<li><p> Let \(b_1, b_2 \in  \theta (H)\). Then there exists \(a_1,a_2\in H\) such that \(\theta \left(a_1\right) = b_1\), \(\theta \left(a_2\right) =
b_2\). Recall that a compact necessary and sufficient condition for \(H \leq  G\) is that \(x*y^{-1}\in H\)  for all \(x, y \in H\).  Now we
apply the same fact in G' :



 \(b_1\diamond b_2{}^{-1} = \theta \left(a_1\right)\diamond \theta \left(a_2\right){}^{-1}\\
\\
\quad \quad =\theta \left(a_1\right)\diamond \theta \left(a_2{}^{-1}\right)\\
\\
\quad \quad =\theta \left(a_1*a_2{}^{-1}\right)\in \theta (H)\)



since  \(a_1*a_2{}^{-1}\in H\), and so we can conclude that  \(\theta (H)\leq G'\). $\blacksquare $

\pmb{ Corollary}.  Since a homomorphism need not be a surjection and part (c) of Theorem 15.4.2 is true for the case of \(H = G\), the range of
\(\theta\), \(\theta (G)\), is a subgroup of \(G'\)

<example xml:id="ex-15.4.9."><title>15.4.9.</title><p></p></example> If we define \(\pi : \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow  \mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z}\) by \(\pi (n) = n + 4\mathbb{Z}\). then \(\pi\) is a
homomorphism. The image of the subgroup \(4\mathbb{Z}\) is the single coset \(0 + 4\mathbb{Z}\), the identity of the factor group. Homomorphisms
of this type are called natural homomorphisms. . The following theorems will verify that $\pi $ is a homomorphism and also show the connection
between homomorphisms and normal subgroups. The reader can find more detail and proofs in most abstract algebra texts.

(15.4.3)\(\textrm{     }\pi : \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow  \mathbb{Z}/10\mathbb{Z}\) defined by \(\pi (n) = n + 10\mathbb{Z}\) is a homomorphism.

(15.4.5)   \(\mathbb{Z}/10\mathbb{Z}\) is isomorphic to \(\mathbb{Z}_{10}\) .

<example xml:id="ex-15.4.11."><title>15.4.11.</title><p></p></example>  Let <m>G</m> be the same group of two by two invertible real matrices as in Example 15.4.6.  Define \(\Phi : G \rightarrow
 G\) by \(\Phi (A) = \frac{A}{\sqrt{\left| \det  A\right| }}\). We will let the reader verify that \(\Phi\) is a homomorphism. The theorems above
imply:



(15.4.4) \(\ker  \Phi  = \{A|\Phi (A) =I\} = \left\{ \left.\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
 a &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; a \\

 \Phi  = H_1\).



(15.4.5) \(G\left/H_1\right.\) is isomorphic to \(\{A\in G|\det  A= \pm 1\}\).



(15.4.3)  \(\pi : G ---> G\left/H_1\right.\) defined, naturally, by \(\pi (A) =A H_1\) is a homomorphism.



For the remainder of this section, we will be examining certain kinds of homomorphisms that will play a part in our major application to homomorphisms,
coding theory.

<example xml:id="ex-15.4.12."><title>15.4.12.</title><p></p></example> Consider  \(\Phi :\mathbb{Z}_2{}^2\to \mathbb{Z}_2{}^3\) defined by \(\Phi (a, b) = \left(a, b, a +_2 b\right)\).   If
\(\left(a_1,b_1\right), \left(a _2 , b_2 \right) \in  \mathbb{Z}_2{}^2\),

\(\Phi \left(\left(a_1,b_1\right)+\left(a _2 , b_2 \right)\right) = \Phi \left(a_1+_2a_2,b_1 +_2 b_2 \right)\\
\\
\quad \quad \quad = \left(a_1+_2a_2,b_1 +_2 b_2 ,a_1+_2a_2+_2b_1 +_2 b_2\right)\\
\\
\quad \quad \quad = \left(a_1,b_1 , a_1+_2b_1\right)+\left(a_2,b_2 , a_2+_2b_2\right)\\
\\
\quad \quad \quad =\Phi \left(a_1,b_1\right)+\Phi \left(a _2 , b_2 \right)\)

Since \(\Phi (a, b)\text = (0, 0, 0)\) implies that \(a = 0\) and \(b = 0\), the kernel of \(\Phi\) is \(\{(0, 0)\}\). By previous theorems, \(\Phi
\left(\mathbb{Z}_2{}^2\right)= \{(0, 0, 0), (1, 0, 1), (0, 1, 1), (1, 1, 0)\}\) is isomorphic to \(\mathbb{Z}_2{}^2\) .

We can generalize the previous example as follows: If \(n, m \geq  1\) and <m>A</m> an \(m\times  n\) matrix of 0{'}s and 1{'}s (elements of \(\mathbb{Z}_2\)),
then \(\Phi :\mathbb{Z}_2{}^m\to \mathbb{Z}_2{}^n\) defined by

\(\Phi \left(a_1, a_2 , . . . , a _m \right) = \left(a_1, a_2 , . . . , a _m\right)A\)

is a homomorphism. This is true because matrix multiplication is distributive over addition. The only new idea here is that computation is done in
\(\mathbb{Z}_2\) where \(1 +_2 1 = 0\).  If \(a=\left(a_1, a_2 , . . . , a _m\right)\) and \(b=\left(b_1, b_2 , . . . , b _m\right)\), \((a + b)A
= a A + b A\) is true by basic matrix laws.  Therefore, \(\Phi (a + b) = \Phi (a) + \Phi (b)\).

<exercise number="10"><statement>  Following up on Example 11.4.6,  prove that \(A_5\) is a simple group; i. e., it has no proper normal subgroups.

<ol label="a">
<li><p> Make a list of  the different cycle structures that occur in \(A_5\) and how many elements have those structures.  </p></li>
<li><p>  Within each set of permutations with different cycle structures, identify which subsets are closed with respect to the conjugation operation.
 With this you will have a partition of \(A_5\) into conjugate classes.  where for each class <m>C</m>, 



\(f, g\in  C\)   if and only if   \(\exists  \phi  \in A_5\)  such that  \(\phi ^{-1}\circ f\circ  \phi  = g\)</p></li>
<li><p>   Use the fact that a normal subgroup of \(A_5\) needs to be a union of conjugate classes and verify that no such union exists.
