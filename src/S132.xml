In this section, we restrict our discussion to lattices. , those posets where every pair of elements has a lub.  and a glb. .
We first introduce some notation.



\pmb{ Definitions}:   Join, Meet. Let L be a poset under an ordering . $\leq $ . Let . \(a, b \in  L\). We define:. 



   . \(a \lor  b\) (read <q>a join b</q>) as the least upper bound of \(a\) and \(b\), and . 



   . \(a \land  b\) (read <q>a meet b</q>) as greatest lower bound of \(a\) and \(b\).. 



Since the join and meet\textit operations produce a unique result  in all cases where they exist, by Theorem 13.1.1, we can consider them as
binary operations on a set if they aways exist.   Thus the following definition:

<definition xml:id="def-id"><title>title</title><index><main>title</main></index><notation><usage></usage><description></description></notation><statement><p></p></statement></definition>\pmb{  Lattice}. A lattice is a poset L (under . $\leq $\textit{  ) in which every pair of elements has a lub and a glb.
Since a lattice L is an algebraic system with binary operations }$\lor $ and . $\land $ , it is denoted by . \([L; \lor , \land ]\)\textit{
.}



   In Example 13.1.2, the operation table for the lub.  operation is easy, although admittedly tedious, to do.  We can observe that every
pair of elements in this poset has a least upper bound. In fact, \(A\lor B = A \cup  B\).



   The reader is encouraged to write out the operation table for the glb . operation and to note that every pair of elements in this poset
also has a glb. , so that \(\mathcal{P}(A)\) together with these two operations is a lattice. We further observe that:



   (1)  \([\mathcal{P}(A); \lor  ,\land  ]\) is a lattice (under $\subseteq $ ) for any set <m>A</m>, and



  (2) the join operation is the set operation of union and the meet operation is the operation intersection; that is, \(\lor \text =\cup\) and
\(\land \text =\cap\) .



It can be shown (see the exercises) that the commutative laws, associative laws, idempotent laws, and absorption laws are all true for any lattice.
An example of this is clearly \([\mathcal{P}(A); \cup  , \cap  ]\), since these laws hold in the algebra of sets.  This lattice is also distributive
in that join is distributive over meet and meet is distributive over join. This is not always the case for lattices in general however.

 Distributive Lattice.}  Let . \([L; \lor  , \land ]\) be a lattice (under . $\leq $). . \([L; \lor
 , \land  \}\) is called a distributive lattice if and only if the distributive laws hold; that is, for all . \(a, b, c \in  L\)\textit{
, we have:}



                         \(a \lor  (b \land  c) = (a \lor  b) \land  (a \lor  c)\) and 



                         \(a \land  (b \lor  c) = (a \land  b) \lor  (a \land  c)\).



<example xml:id="ex-13.2.1. { "><title>13.2.1. { </title><p></p></example>} If <m>A</m> is any set, the lattice \([\mathcal{P}(A); \cup  , \cap ]\)  is distributive.



<example xml:id="ex-13.2.2."><title>13.2.2.</title><p></p></example>   We now give an example of a lattice where the distributive laws do not hold. Let \(L = \{1, 2, 3, 5, 30\}\). Then \textit{
L} is a poset under the relation divides. The operation tables for $\lor $ and $\land $ on <m>L</m> are:



   $\quad \quad $\(\begin{array}{c|c}
 \lor  &amp; 
\begin{array}{ccccc}
 1 &amp; \text 2\text  &amp; 3\text  &amp;  5 &amp; \text 30 \\
\end{array}
 \\
\hline
 
\begin{array}{c}
 1 \\
 2 \\
 3 \\
 5 \\
 30 \\
\end{array}
 &amp; 
\begin{array}{ccccc}
 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 5 &amp; 30 \\
 2 &amp; 2 &amp; 30 &amp; 30 &amp; 30 \\
 3 &amp; 30 &amp; 3 &amp; 30 &amp; 30 \\
 5 &amp; 30 &amp; 30 &amp; 5 &amp; 30 \\
 30 &amp; 30 &amp; 30 &amp; 30 &amp; 30 \\
\end{array}
 \\
\end{array}\)



   $\quad \quad $\(\begin{array}{c|c}
 \land  &amp; 
\begin{array}{ccccc}
 1 &amp; \text 2\text  &amp; 3\text  &amp;  5 &amp; \text 30 \\
\end{array}
 \\
\hline
 
\begin{array}{c}
 1 \\
 2 \\
 3 \\
 5 \\
 30 \\
\end{array}
 &amp; 
\begin{array}{ccccc}
 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\
 1 &amp; 2 &amp;  1 &amp;  1 &amp;  2 \\
 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 3 &amp;  1 &amp;  3 \\
 1 &amp;  1 &amp;  1 &amp; 5 &amp;  5 \\
 1 &amp;  2 &amp;  3 &amp;  5 &amp; 30 \\
\end{array}
 \\
\end{array}\)



   Since every pair of elements in <m>L</m> has both a join and a meet, \([L; \lor  , \land ]\) is a lattice (under divides). Is this lattice
distributive? We note that:



                          \(2 \lor  (5 \land  3) = 2 \lor  1 = 2\) and



                          \((2 \lor  5) \land  (2 \lor  3) = 30 \land  30 = 30\),



so that \(a \lor  (b \land  c) \neq  (a \lor  b) \land  (a \lor  c)\) for some values of \(a, b, c \in  L\). Hence <m>L</m> is not a distributive
lattice.



   It can be shown that a lattice is nondistributive if and only if it contains a sublattice isomorphic to one of the lattices in Figure 13.2.1.

Nondistributive lattices}}



   It is interesting to note that for the relation <q>divides</q> on $\mathbb{P}$, if \(a, b \in  \mathbb{P}\) we have:



   \(a \lor  b = \textrm{ \textit{lcm}}\textrm{ \textit{$($}}a, b)\), the least common multiple of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>; that is, the smallest
integer (in $\mathbb{P}$) that is divisible by both <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>;    



   \(a \land  b = \textrm{ \textit{$\gcd $}}(a, b)\), the greatest common divisor of \(a\) and \(b\); that is, the largest integer that divides both a and
b.
