In order to define a Boolean algebra, we need the additional concept of complementation.



Definition:  Complemented Lattice. Let . \([L; \lor ,\land ]\).  be a lattice that contains a least element, . 0\textit{
, and a greatest element, }1. . \([L;\lor ,\land ]\). \textit{  is called a complemented lattice if and only if for every element
}\(a\in L\). , there exists an element . \(\bar{a}\) in L such that . \(a\land \bar{a. =0\)} and . \textit{
\(a\lor \bar{a}=1\)}. Such an element . \(\bar{a}\) is called a complement of the element a.. 

<example xml:id="ex-13.3.1. { "><title>13.3.1. { </title><p></p></example>} Let \(L = \mathcal{P}(A)\), where \(A = \{a, b, c\}\). Then \([L; \cup  , \cap ]\) is a bounded lattice with \(0 = \emptyset\)
and \(1 = A\). Then, to find if it exists, the complement, \(\bar{B}\), of, say \(B = \{a, b\} \in  L\), we want \(\bar{B}\) such that

\(\textrm{ }\)                           \(\{a,b\} \cap \bar{B} = \emptyset\) and \(\{a,b\} \cup  \bar{B} = A\).

Here, \(\bar{B} = \{c\}\), and since it can be shown that each element of <m>L</m> has a complement (see Exercise 1), \([L; \cup  , \cap ]\) is
a complemented lattice. Note that if <m>A</m> is any set and \(L = \mathcal{P}(A)\), then \([L; \cup  , \cap ]\) is a complemented lattice where
the complement of \(B \in  L\) is \(\bar{B} = B ^c = A - B\).



   In Example 13.3.1, we observe that the complement of each element of L is unique. Is this always the case? The answer is no. Consider the following.

<example xml:id="ex-13.3.2."><title>13.3.2.</title><p></p></example>   Let \(L = \{1, 2, 3, 5, 30\}\) and consider the lattice \([L; \lor  , \land ]\) (under <q>divides</q>). The least element
of <m>L</m> is 1 and the greatest element is 30. Let us compute the complement of the element \(a = 2\). We want to determine \(\bar{a}\) such
that \(2 \land  \bar{a} = 1\) and \(2 \lor  \bar{a} = 30\). Certainly, \(\bar{a} = 3\) works, but so does \(\bar{a} = 5\), so the complement of \(a
= 2\) in this lattice is not unique. However, \([L; \lor  , \land ]\) is still a complemented lattice since each element does have at least one complement.



   The following theorem gives us an insight into when uniqueness of complements occurs.



<theorem xml:id="theorem-13.3.1. { "><title>13.3.1. { </title><index><main>13.3.1. { </main></index><statement><p></p></statement><proof></proof></theorem>} If . \([L; \lor  , \land ]\) is a complemented and distributive lattice, then the complement . \(\bar{a}\)\textit{
 of any element }\(a \in  L\) is unique.. 



   Proof: Let \(a \in  L\) and assume to the contrary that <m>a</m> has two complements, namely \(a_1\) and \(a_2\). Then by definition of complement,



                            \(a \land  a_1 = 0\) and \(a \lor  a_1 = 1\), 



Also,



                            \(a \land  a_2 = 0\) and \(a \lor  a_2 = 1\). 



So that



                                  \(\text a_1 =\textrm{    }a_1 \land  1 = a_1 \land  \left(a \lor  a_2\right)\textrm{ 
         }=\left(a_1 \land  a\right) \lor  \left(a_1 \land  a_2\right)\textrm{           }=0 \lor  \left(a_1 \land  a_2\right)\textrm{           }=a_1
\land  a_2.\)



On the other hand,



                                   \(a_2 = a_2 \land  1 = a_2 \land  \left(a \lor  a_1\right)\\
\\
\textrm{         }= \left(a_2 \land  a\right) \lor  \left(a_2 \land  a_1\right)\\
\\
\textrm{         }= 0 \lor  \left(a_2 \land  a_1\right)\\
\\
\textrm{         }= a_2 \land  a_1.\)



Hence \(a_1 = a_2\), which contradicts the assumption that <m>a</m> has two different complements, \(a_1\) and \(a_2\).  \(\blacksquare\)

 Boolean Algebra.}  \textit{ A Boolean algebra is a lattice that contains a least element and a greatest element and that
is both complemented and distributive.}



   Since the complement of each element in a Boolean algebra is unique (by Theorem 13.3.1), complementation is a valid unary operation over the
set under discussion, and we will list it together with the other two operations to emphasize that we are discussing a set together with three operations.
Also, to help emphasize the distinction between lattices and lattices that are Boolean algebras, we will use the letter <m>B</m> as the generic
symbol for the set of a Boolean algebra; that is, \([B; -, \lor , \land ]\) will stand for a general Boolean algebra.



<example xml:id="ex-13.3.3."><title>13.3.3.</title><p></p></example>   Let <m>A</m> be any set, and let \(B = \mathcal{P}(A)\). Then \([B; c, \cup  , \cap ]\) is a Boolean algebra. Here,
<m>c</m> stands for the complement of an element of <m>B</m> with respect to A, . \(A-B\).



   This is a key example for us since all finite Boolean algebras and many infinite Boolean algebras look like this example for some <m>A</m>.
In fact, a glance at the basic Boolean algebra laws in Table 13.3.1, in comparison with the set laws of Chapter 4 and the basic laws of logic of
Chapter 3, indicates that all three systems behave the same; that is, they are isomorphic.



   The <q>pairing</q> of the above laws reminds us of the principle of duality, which we state for a Boolean algebra.



<definition xml:id="def-id"><title>title</title><index><main>title</main></index><notation><usage></usage><description></description></notation><statement><p></p></statement></definition>   Principle of Duality for Boolean Algebras. Let . \([B; -, \lor , \land ]\) be a Boolean algebra (under . \(\leq\)), and let S be a true statement for . \([B; -, \lor , \land ]\). If . \(S^*\) is obtained from S by replacing . \(\leq\)\textit{
 by }\(\geq\) (this is equivalent to turning the graph upside down), . \(\lor\) by . \(\land\), . \(\land\) by . $\lor
$, . 0 by . 1, and . 1 by . 0, then . \(S^*\) is also a true statement..

   We close this section with some comments on notation. The notation for operations in a Boolean algebra is derived from the algebra of logic.
However, other notations are used. These are summarized in the following chart;



  \(\begin{array}{c|ccc}
 \textrm{ Notation} \textrm{ used} \textrm{ in} \textrm{ this} \textrm{ text}(\textrm{ Mathematics} \textrm{ notation}) &amp; \textrm{ Set} \textrm{ Notation} &amp; \textrm{ Logic} \textrm{ Design}
(\textrm{ CS}/\textrm{ EE} \textrm{ notation}) &amp; \textrm{ Read} \textrm{ as} \\
\hline
 \lor  &amp; \cup  &amp; \oplus  &amp; \textrm{ join} \\
 \land  &amp; \cap  &amp; \otimes  &amp; \textrm{ meet} \\
  \bar  &amp; c &amp; \bar  &amp; \textrm{ complement} \\
 \leq  &amp; \subseteq  &amp; \leq  &amp; \textrm{ underlying} \textrm{ partial} \textrm{ ordering} \\
\end{array}\)



   Mathematicians most frequently use the notation of the text, and, on occasion, use set notation for Boolean algebras. Thinking in terms of sets
may be easier for some people. Computer designers traditionally use the arithmetic and notation.  In this latter notation, DeMorgan's Laws become:</p></li>
<li><p>   \(\overline{a \oplus  b} = \bar{a} \otimes  \bar{b}\) 



and



(9')   \(\overline{a \otimes  b} = \bar{a} \oplus  \bar{b}\).
