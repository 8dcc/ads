<p>It is quite clear that most of these laws resemble or, in fact, are analogues of laws in basic algebra and the algebra of propositions.</p>


<subsection xml:id="ss-proof-with-theorems"><title>Proof Using Previously Proven Theorems</title>
<p>Once a few basic laws or theorems have been established, we frequently use them to prove additional theorems. This method of proof is usually more efficient than that of proof by Definition. To illustrate, let us prove the following Corollary to the Distributive Law.   The term "corollary" is used for theorems that can be proven with relative ease from previously proven theorems.
</p>
<corollary xml:id="th-corrollary-to-distr"><title>A Corollary to the Distributive Law of Sets</title>
<statement> Let A and B be sets. Then \((A\cap  B) \cup  (A\cap  B^c) = A\).
</statement>
<proof>
<me>
\begin{split}
((A\cap  B) \cup  (A\cap  B^c) &amp; = A \cap (B \cup B^c) &amp; Why?\\
&amp; = A \cap U &amp; Why?\\
&amp; = A &amp;Why? \\
\end{split}
</me>
</proof>
</corollary>

<subsection xml:id="ss-proof-sets-contradiction"><title>Proof Using the Indirect Method/Contradiction</title>
<p>The procedure one most frequently uses to prove a theorem in mathematics is the Direct Method, as illustrated in Theorems 4.1.1 and 4.1.2. Occasionally there are situations where this method is not applicable. Consider the following:</p>

<theorem xml:id="theorem-example-sets-contradiction">
<title>An Indirect Proof in Set Theory</title>
<statement>Let \(A, B, C\) be sets. If \(A\subseteq B\) and \(B\cap C = \emptyset\), then \(A\cap C = \emptyset\).</statement> 
</theorem>

<p>Commentary: The usual and first approach would be to assume \(A\subseteq B\) and \(B\cap C = \emptyset\) is true and to attempt to prove \(A\cap C = \emptyset\) is true. To do this you would need to show that nothing is contained in the set \(A \cap  C\). Think about how you would show that something doesn't exist. It is very difficult to do directly.</p>

<p>The Indirect Method is much easier: If we assume the conclusion is false and we obtain a contradiction ---  then the theorem must be true. This approach is on sound logical footing since it is exactly the same method of indirect proof that we discussed in <xref ref="ss-indirect-proof" autoname="yes" /></p>

<proof xml:id="proof-example-sets-contradiction">
<p>Assume \(A\subseteq B\) and \(B\cap C = \emptyset\), and \(A\cap C \neq  \emptyset\). To prove that this cannot
occur, let \(x\in A \cap C\).</p>
<p><me>
\begin{split}
x \in A \cap C &amp; \Rightarrow x \in A \textrm{ and } x \in  C &amp; Why?\\
	&amp; \Rightarrow x \in B \textrm{ and } x \in  C &amp; Why?\\
	&amp; \Rightarrow x \in  B \cap C &amp; Why?\\
\end{split}
</me></p>
<p>But this contradicts the second premise.  Hence, the theorem is proven. \(\blacksquare \) </p>
</proof>

<exercise number="5"><title>Hierarchy of Set Operations</title> <statement><p>The rules that determine the order of evaluation in a set expression that involves more than one operation are similar to the rules for logic. In the absence of parentheses, complementations are done first, intersections second, and unions third. Parentheses are used to override this order. If the same operation appears two or more consecutive times, evaluate from left to right. In what order are the
following expressions performed?</p>
<ol style="a">
<li>\(A \cup  B^c\cap C\). </li>
<li>\(A\cap B \cup  C\cap B\). </li>
