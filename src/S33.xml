<p>Consider two propositions generated by <m>p</m> and <m>q</m>: \(\neg (p \land  q)\) and \(\neg p \lor  \neg q\). At first glance, they are different propositions. In form, they are different, but they have the same meaning. One way to see this is to substitute actual propositions for <m>p</m> and <m>q</m>; such as
<m>p</m>: I've been to Toronto; and <m>q</m>: I've been to Chicago.</p>

<p>Then \(\neg (p \land  q)\) translates to <q>I haven't been to both Toronto and Chicago,</q> while \(\neg p \lor  \neg q.\) is <q>I haven't been to Toronto or I haven't been to Chicago.</q> Determine the truth values of these propositions. Naturally, they will be true for some people and false for others. What is important is that no matter what truth values they have, \(\neg (p \land  q)\) and \(\neg p \lor  \neg q.\) will have the same truth value. The easiest way to see this is by examining the truth tables of these propositions.</p>

<table xml:id="tt33-1">
<caption>Truth Tables for <m>\neg (p \land  q)</m> and <m>\neg p \lor  \neg q</m></caption>

<p>In all four cases, \(\neg (p \land  q)\) and \(\neg p \lor  \neg q.\) have the same truth value. Furthermore, when the biconditional operator is applied to them, the result is a value of true in all cases.  A proposition such as this is called a tautology.</p>

<subsection><title>Equivalence</title>

<definition xml:id="def-equivalence"><title> Equivalence</title><statement> Let <m>S</m> be a set of propositions and let <m>r</m> and <m>s</m> be propositions generated by <m>S</m>. <m>r</m> and <m>s</m> are equivalent if and only if \(r\leftrightarrow s\) is a tautology. The equivalence of <m>r</m> and <m>s</m> is denoted \(r \iff s\).
</statement><notation><usage> r \iff s</usage><description><m>r</m> is logically equivalent to <m>s</m></description></notation>
</definition>

<p>Equivalence is to logic as equality is to algebra. Just as there are many ways of writing an algebraic expression, the same logical meaning can be expressed in many different ways.</p>

<example xml:id="ex-some-equivalences."><title>Some Equivalences</title><p>The following are all equivalences:
<ol style="a">
<li> \((p \land q)\lor  (\neg p \land q)\iff q\).</li>

</li>
<li>\(p \lor  q \iff q \lor p\).</li>

<p>All tautologies are equivalent to one another.</p>

<subsection><title>Implication</title>
<subsubsection xml:id="ex_doors_implication"><title>Where is the money?</title>
<p>Consider the two propositions:</p>
<table>
<tabular top="none" halign="center">
<row><cell><m>x</m>: The money is behind Door A; and</cell></row>
<row><cell><m>y</m>: The money is behind Door A or Door B.</cell></row>
</tabular>
</table>
<p>Imagine that you were told that there is a large sum of money behind one of two doors marked A and B, and that one of the two propositions <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> is true and the other is false. Which door would you choose? All that you need to realize is that if <m>x</m> is true, then <m>y</m> will also be true. Since we know that this can't be the case, <m>y</m> must be the true proposition and the money is behind Door B.</p>

<p>This is an example of a situation in which the truth of one proposition leads to the truth of another. Certainly, <m>y</m> can be true when <m>x</m> is false; but <m>x</m> can't be true when <m>y</m> is false. In this case, we say that <m>x</m> implies  <m>y</m>.</p>
</subsubsection>
<p>Consider the truth table of \(p \to  q\),  <xref ref="tt-conditional" />. If <m>p</m> implies <m>q</m>, then the third case can be ruled out, since it is the case that makes a conditional proposition false.</p>

<definition xml:id="def-implication"><title>Implication</title><statement> Let S be a set of propositions and let r and s be propositions generated by S. We say that r implies s if \(r \to s\) is a tautology. We write \(r \Rightarrow  s\) to indicate this implication.</statement>
<notation><usage>r \Rightarrow  s</usage><description><m>r</m> implies <m>s</m></description></notation></definition>

<example xml:id="ex-disjunctive-addition"><title>Disjunctive Addition</title><p>A commonly used implication called <q>disjunctive addition</q> is  <m>p \Rightarrow (p \lor  q)</m>, which is verified by truth table <xref ref="tt-disjunctive-addition" />.</p></example>

<table xml:id="tt-disjunctive-addition">
<caption>Truth Table for to verify that <m>p \Rightarrow (p \lor  q)</m></caption>
<tabular top="major" halign="center">
<row><cell><m> p</m> </cell><cell><m> q</m> </cell><cell><m> p\lor q </m></cell><cell><m> p\to p\lor q </m></cell></row>

<p>If we let <m>p</m> represent <q>The money is behind Door A</q> and <m>q</m> represent <q>The money is behind Door B,</q> \(p \Rightarrow (p \lor  q)\) is a formalized version of the reasoning used in <xref ref="ex-disjunctive-addition" />. A common name for this implication is disjunctive addition. In the next section we will consider some of the most commonly used implications and equivalences.</p>

<p>When we defined what we mean by a <xref ref="def-proposition-generated-by-set" autoname="title" />, we didn't include the conditional and biconditional operators. This was because of the two equivalences \(p \to  q \Leftrightarrow  \neg p \lor  q\) and \(p \leftrightarrow  q \Leftrightarrow  (p \land  q) \lor  (\neg p \land  \neg q)\). Therefore, any proposition that includes the conditional or biconditional operators can be written in an equivalent way using only conjunction, disjunction, and negation. We could even dispense with disjunction since \(p \lor  q\) is equivalent to a proposition that uses only conjunction and negation.</p>
