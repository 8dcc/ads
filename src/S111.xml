<introduction>One of the first mathematical skills that we all learn is how to add a pair of positive integers. A young child soon recognizes that something is wrong if a sum has two values, particularly if his or her sum is different from the teacher's. In addition, it is unlikely that a child would consider assigning a non-positive value to the sum of two positive integers. In other words, at an early age we probably know that the sum of two positive integers is unique and belongs to the set of positive integers. This is what characterizes all binary operations on a set.</introduction>

<example xml:id="ex-some-binary-operations"><title>Some common binary operations</title><p>Union and intersection are both binary operations on the power set of any universe. Addition and multiplication are binary operators on the natural numbers. Addition and multiplication are binary operations on the set of 2 by 2 real matrices, \(M_{2\times 2}(\mathbb{R})\).  Division is a binary operation on some sets of numbers, such as the positive reals. But on the integers (\(1/2\notin \mathbb{Z}\)) and even on the real numbers \((1/0\) is not defined), division is not a binary operation.</p></example>

<li><p> We stress that the image of each ordered pair must be in <m>S</m>. This requirement disqualifies subtraction on the natural numbers from consideration as a binary operation, since \(1 - 2\) is not a natural number. Subtraction is.  a binary operation on the integers.</p></li>
<li><p>  On Notation. Despite the fact that a binary operation is a function, symbols, not letters, are used to name them. The most commonly used symbol for a binary operation is an asterisk, *. We will also use a diamond, $\diamond $,  when a second symbol is needed.</p></li>
</ol></p>
</note>

<p>  If * is a binary operation on <m>S</m> and \(a, b \in  S\), there are three common ways of denoting the image of the pair \((a, b)\). They are:


\[\begin{array}{ccc}
 *a b &amp; a*b &amp; a b * \\
 \textrm{ Prefix} \textrm{ Form} &amp; \textrm{ Infix} \textrm{ Form} &amp; \textrm{ Postfix} \textrm{ FOrm} \\
\end{array}\]

We are all familiar with infix form. For example, \(2 + 3\) is how everyone is taught to write the sum of 2 and 3. But notice how \(2 + 3\) was just described in the previous sentence! The word sum.  preceded 2 and 3. Orally, prefix form is quite natural to us. The prefix and postfix forms are superior to infix form in some respects. In Chapter 10, we saw that algebraic expressions with more than one operation didn't need parentheses if they were in prefix or postfix form. However, due to our familiarity with infix form, we will use it throughout most of the remainder of this book.</p>
<p>Some operations, such as negation of numbers and complementation of sets, are not binary, but unary operators.</p>

<subsection xml:id="ss-operation-properties"><title>Properties of Operations</title><index><main>Properties of Operations</main></index>



<p>Whenever an operation on a set is encountered, there are several properties that should immediately come to mind. To effectively make use of an operation, you should know which of these properties it has. By now, you should be familiar with most of these properties. We will list the most common ones here to refresh your memory and define them for the first time in a general setting. Let <m>S</m> be any set and <m>*</m> a binary operation on <m>S</m>.</p>



<subsubsection xml:id="sss-Properties that apply to a single binary operation:"><title>Properties that apply to a single binary operation:</title><index><main>Properties that apply to a single binary operation:</main></index>

Let * be a binary operation on a set S

*is \pmb{ commutative} if \(a * b = b * a\)  for all \(a, b \in  S\).

*is \pmb{ associative} if \((a * b) * c = a * (b * c)\) for all \(a, b, c \in  S\).

* \pmb{ has an identity} if there exists an element, e, in <m>S</m> such that \(a * e = e * a = a\) for all a $\in $ <m>S</m>.

* has the \pmb{ inverse property} if for each \(a \in  S\), there exists  \(b \in  S\) such that \(a*b = b*a = e\).  

    We call b an inverse of a.

* is \pmb{ idempotent} if a * a = a for all a $\in $ <m>S</m>. Properties that apply to two binary operations:

Let $\diamond $ be a second binary operation on <m>S</m>.

$\diamond $ is left distributive over * if \(a \diamond  (b * c) = (a \diamond  b) * (a \diamond  c)\) for all \(a,b,c\in S\).

$\diamond $ is right distributive over * if \((b * c)\diamond a = (b\diamond a) * (c \diamond  a)\) for all \(a,b,c \in  S\).

$\diamond $ is distributive over * if $\diamond $ is both left and right distributive over *.

Let  \(-\)  be a unary operation.

A unary operation $---$ on <m>S</m> has the involution property if \(-(-a) = a\) for all \(a \in  S\).

Finally, a property of sets, as they relate to operations.

If T is a subset of S, we say that T is closed under * if \(a, b \in  T\) implies that \(a * b \in  T\). In other words, by operating on elements of T with *, you can't obtain new elements that are outside of T.

<example xml:id="ex-11.1.2."><title>11.1.2.</title><p></p></example><ol label=“a”>
<li><p>  The odd integers are closed under multiplication, but not under addition.</p></li>
<li><p>  Let <m>p</m> be a proposition over <m>U</m> and let A be the set of propositions over <m>U</m> that imply <m>p</m>. That is; \(q \in  A\) if \(q\Rightarrow p\). Then <m>A</m> is closed under both conjunction and disjunction.</p></li>
<li><p>  The set positive integers that are multiples of 5 is closed under both addition and multiplication.



Note: It is important to realize that the properties listed above depend on both the set and the operation(s).



<subsection xml:id="ss-OPERATION TABLES"><title>OPERATION TABLES</title><index><main>OPERATION TABLES</main></index>



If the set on which an operation is defined is small, a table is often a good way of describing the operation. For example, we might want to define \(\oplus\) on \(\{0, 1, 2\}\) by 



$\quad $\(a\oplus b=\left\{
\begin{array}{cc}
 a+b &amp; \textrm{ if} a+b<3 \\
 a+b-3 &amp; \textrm{ if} a+b\geq 3 \\
\end{array}
\right.\)



The table for \(\oplus\) is




The top row and left column are the column and row headings, respectively. To determine \(a\oplus b\), find the entry in Row <m>a</m> and Column
<m>b</m>. The following operation table serves to define * on \(\{i, j, k\}\).



Note that; \(j*k = j\), yet \(k * j = k\). Thus, * is not commutative. Commutivity is easy to identify in a table: the table must be symmetric with
respect to the diagonal going from the top left to lower right.
