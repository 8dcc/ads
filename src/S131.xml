From Chapter 6, Section 3, we recall the following definition:

\pmb{ Definition}:   Poset. \textit{ A set L on which a partial ordering relation (reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive) r is defined is called
a partially ordered set, or poset, for short.}



   We recall a few examples of posets:



   (1) \(L = \mathbb{R}\) and <m>r</m> is the relation $\leq $.



   (2) \(L = \mathcal{P}(A)\) where \(A = \{a, b\}\) and <m>r</m> is the relation $\subseteq $.



   (3) \(L = \{1, 2, 3, 6\}\) and <m>r</m> is the relation $|$ (divides). We remind the reader that the pair \((a, b)\) as an element of the
relation <m>r</m> can be expressed as \((a, b)\in r\), or \(a r b\), depending on convenience and readability.



   The posets we will concentrate on in this chapter will be those which have maxima and minima. These partial orderings resemble that of $\leq
$ on <m>\mathbb{R}</m>, so the symbol $\leq $ is used to replace the symbol <m>r</m> in the definition of a partially ordered set. Hence, the definition
of a poset becomes:

\pmb{ Definition}: Poset.  A set on which a partial ordering, . \(\leq\)\textit{  , is defined is called a partially ordered set, or, in
brief, a poset. Here, $\leq $ is a partial ordering on L if and only if for all }\(a, b, c \in  L\):



   (1)  \(a \leq  a(\textrm{ \textit{reflexivity}})\),



   (2) \(a \leq  b\) and.  \(b \leq  a \Rightarrow  a = b\) (antisymmetry. ), and. 



   We now proceed to introduce maximum and minimum concepts. To do this, we will first define these concepts for two elements of the poset \textit{
L}, and then define the concepts over the whole poset <m>L</m>.

\pmb{ Definition}:   Lower Bound, Upper Bound. Let . \(a, b \in  L\), a poset. Then . \(c \in  L\)\textit{  is a lower bound of
a and b if }\(c \leq  a\) and . \(c \leq  b\). . \(d \in  L\) is an upper bound of a and b if . \(a \leq  d\)\textit{  and
}\(b \leq  d\).

\pmb{ Definition}:\pmb{    Greatest Lower Bound. } Let L be a poset and . $\leq $  be the partial ordering on L.   Let . \(a,
b \in  L\), then. \(g \in  L\) is a greatest lower bound of a and b, denoted . \(\textrm{ glb}(a,b),\)  if and only if . 

\(g \leq  a\) ,. 

\(g \leq  b\),  and

if . \(g' \in  L\) such that if . \(g' \leq  a\) and . \(g' \leq  b\), then . \(g' \leq  g\).  . 



\textup{ The last condition says, in other words, that if . \(g'\)\textup{  is also a lower bound, then }g\textup{  is <q>greater</q> than
}\textup{ \(g'\)}\textup{ , so }g\textup{  is a greatest lower bound.}}



\textup{ The definition of a least upper bound is a mirror image of a greatest lower bound:}

<definition xml:id="def-{ "><title>{ </title><index><main>{ </main></index><notation><usage></usage><description></description></notation><statement><p></p></statement></definition>

Least Upper Bound.}  Let L be a poset and . $\leq $ be the partial ordering on L.   Let . \(a, b \in  L\)\textit{
, then}\(\ell  \in  L\) is a least upper bound of a and b, denoted . \(\textrm{ lub}(a,b),\)  if and only if . 

\(a \leq  \ell\) ,. 

\(b \leq  \ell\),  and

if . \(\ell ' \in  L\) such that if . \(a \leq \ell '\) and . \(b\leq \ell '\), then . \(\ell  \leq  \ell '\)\textit{
.  }



Notice that the two definitions above refer to <q>...a greatest lower bound</q>  and <q>a least upper bound.</q>  Any time you define an object
like these you need to have an open mind as to whether more than one such object can exist.  In fact, we now can prove that there can't be two
greatest lower bounds or two least upper bounds.

<theorem xml:id="theorem-13.1.1."><title>13.1.1.</title><index><main>13.1.1.</main></index><statement></statement><proof></proof></theorem>   Let L be a poset and . $\leq $ be the partial ordering on L, and . \(a, b \in  L\)..   If a
greatest lower bound of a . and <m>b</m> exists, then it is unique.  The same is true of a least upper bound, if it exists.

Proof:   Let <m>g</m> and g'.  be greatest lower bounds of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.   We will prove that \(g=g'\). <ol label=“1”>
<li><p> \(g a \textrm{ greatest} \textrm{ lower} \textrm{ bound} \textrm{ of} a \textrm{ and} b \Rightarrow  g \textrm{ is} a \textrm{ lower} \textrm{ bound} \textrm{ of} a
\textrm{ and} b.\)</p></li>
<li><p>  \(g'\) a greatest lower bound of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> and  g . a lower bound of <m>a</m> and b . \(\Rightarrow 
g\leq g'\) by the definition of greatest lower bound.</p></li>
<li><p>  \(g' a \textrm{ greatest} \textrm{ lower} \textrm{ bound} \textrm{ of} a \textrm{ and} b \Rightarrow  g' \textrm{ is} a \textrm{ lower} \textrm{ bound} \textrm{ of}
a \textrm{ and} b.\)</p></li>
<li><p>  \(g\) a greatest lower bound of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> and  g' . a lower bound of <m>a</m> and b . \(\Rightarrow 
g'\leq g\) by the definition of greatest lower bound.</p></li>
<li><p>   \(g\leq g'\text \textrm{ and} g'\leq g \Rightarrow  g=g'\)  by the antisymmetry property of a partial ordering. 

The proof of the second statement in the theorem is almost identical to the first and is left to the reader.  $\blacksquare $

<definition xml:id="def-{ "><title>{ </title><index><main>{ </main></index><notation><usage></usage><description></description></notation><statement><p></p></statement></definition>

 Greatest Element, Least Element.} Let . L be a\textup poset.    . \(M\in L\)\textit{  is called the
greatest (maximum) element of L if, for all }\(a \in  L\), . \(a \leq  M\). In addition, . \(m \in  L\)\textit{  is called the least
(minimum) element of L if for all }\(a \in  L\), . \(m \leq  a\).. 

\textup{ Note: The greatest and least elements, when they exist, are frequently denoted by 1 and 0 respectively.}

<example xml:id="ex-13.1.1."><title>13.1.1.</title><p></p></example>   Let \(L = \{1, 3, 5, 7, 15, 21, 35, 105\}\) and let $\leq $ be the relation $|$ (divides) on <m>L</m>. Then \textit{
L} is a poset. To determine the lub.  of 3 and 7, we look for all \(\ell  \in  L\), such that \(3|\ell\) and \(7|\ell\). Certainly, both
\(\ell  = 21\) and \(\ell  = 105\) satisfy these conditions and no other element of <m>L</m> does. Next, since \(21|105\), then \(21 = \textrm{ lub}(3,7)\).
Similarly, the \(\textrm{ \textit{lub}}(3,5)=15.\) The greatest element of <m>L</m> is 105 since \(a|105\) for all \(a \in  L\). To find the \textit{
glb} of 15 and 35, we first consider all elements <m>g</m> of <m>L</m> such that <m>g</m> $|$ 15 and <m>g</m> $|$ 35. Certainly, both
\(g = 5\) and \(g = 1\) satisfy these conditions. But since \(1|5\), then  \(\textrm{ \textit{glb}}(15,35)=5\). The least element of <m>L</m> is
1 since \(1|a\) for all \(a \in  L\).



   Henceforth, for any positive integer <m>n</m>, \(D_n\) will denote the set of all positive integers which are divisors of <m>n</m>. For
example, the set <m>L</m> of Example 13.1.1 is \(D_{105}\).

<example xml:id="ex-13.1.2."><title>13.1.2.</title><p></p></example>   Consider the poset \(\mathcal{P}(A)\), where \(A = \{a, b, c\}\), with the relation $\subseteq $ on \(\mathcal{P}(A)\).
The glb.  of the \(\{a, b\}\) and \(\{a, c\}\) is \(g = \{a\}\). For any other element g' . of <m>M</m> which is a subset of \(\{a,
b\}\) and \(\{a, c\}\) (there is only one; what is it?), \(g' \subseteq  g\). The least element of \(\mathcal{P}(A)\) is $\emptyset $ and the greatest
element of $\mathcal{P}$(A) is \(A=\{a, b, c\}\). The Hasse diagram of $\mathcal{P}$(A) is shown in Figure 13.1.1.

\includegraphics{C13a_gr1.eps}


\caption{Figure 13.1.1\\
Example 13.1.2}



   With a little practice, it is quite easy to find the least upper bounds and greatest lower bounds of all possible pairs in \(\mathcal{P}(A)\)
directly from the graph of the poset.



   The previous examples and definitions indicate that the lub.  and glb.  are defined in terms of the partial ordering of the
given poset. It is not yet clear whether all posets have the property such every pair of elements has both a lub.  and a glb. . Indeed,
this is not the case (see Exercise 3).
