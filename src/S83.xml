<title>Recurrence Relations</title>
<p>In this section we will begin our study of recurrence relations and their solutions. Our primary focus will be on the class of finite order linear
recurrence relations with constant coefficients (shortened to finite order linear relations). First, we will examine closed form
expressions from which these relations arise. Second, we will present an algorithm for solving them. In later sections we will consider some other
common relations (8.4) and introduce two additional tools for studying recurrence relations: generating functions (8.5) and matrix methods (Chapter
12).</p>

<definition xml:id="def- Recurrence Relation."><title> Recurrence Relation.</title><statement><p>Let S be a sequence of numbers, A recurrence relation on <m>S</m> is a formula that relates all but a finite number of terms of <m>S</m> to previous terms of <m>S</m>.

<li><p> The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation \(F_k= F_{k-2}+ F_{k-1}\),\(k\geq 2,\) with the initial conditions \(F_0=1\) and \(F_1=1\). The recurrence relation is called a second-order relation because \(F_k\) depends on the two previous terms of
<m>F</m>. Recall that the sequence <m>C</m> in Section 8.2, <xref ref="ex-three-sequences"/>, can be defined with the same recurrence relation, but with different initial conditions.</p></li>
<li><p> The relation \(T(k) = 2T(k - 1)^2 - k T(k - 3)\) is a third-order recurrence relation. If values of \(T(0)\), \(T(1)\), and \(T(2)\)

<p>Sequences are often most easily defined with a recurrence relation; however, the calculation of terms by directly applying a recurrence relation
can be time consuming. The process of determining a closed form expression for the terms of a sequence from its recurrence relation is called solving
the relation. There is no single technique or algorithm that can be used to solve all recurrence relations. In fact, some recurrence relations cannot
be solved. The relation that defines <m>T</m> above is one such example. Most of the recurrence relations that you are likely to encounter in
the future as classified as finite order linear recurrence relations with constant coefficients. This class is the one that we will spend most of
our time with in this chapter.</p>

<definition xml:id="def-n-th-order-rr"><title><m>n^{th}</m> Order Recurrence Relation</title> </title><statement><p>Let S be a sequence of numbers with domain \(k\geq 0\).An \(n^{\text{th}}\)

\[S(k) + C_1 S(k - 1) + . . . + C_n S(k - n) = f(k)\textrm{  for  }k \geq  n\]

where \(C_1, C_2, \ldots , C_n\) are constants and <m>f</m> is a numeric function that is defined for \(k \geq n\).</p></statement><index><main>Order of a Recurrence Relation</main></index></definition>

<p>Note: We will shorten the name of this class of relations to \(n^{\text{th}}\) order linear relations. Therefore, in further discussions, \(S(k)
+ 2k S(k --- 1) = 0\) would not be considered a first-order linear relation.</p>

<p>Before giving an algorithm for solving finite order linear relations, we will examinerecurrence relations that arise from certain closed form
expressions. The closed form expressions are selected so that we will obtain finite order linear relations from them. This approach
may seem a bit contrived, but if you were to write down a few simple algebraic expressions, chances are that most of them would be similar to the
ones we are about to examine.</p>

<example xml:id="ex-solving-backwards"><title>Working Backwards</title><ol label="a">
<li><p> Consider D, defined by \(D(k) =5\cdot 2^k\), \(k \geq  0\). If \(k \geq  1\),

$\quad $\(D(k) =5\cdot 2^k = 2\cdot 5\cdot 2^{k-1} = 2 D(k - 1)\).

Therefore, <m>D</m> satisfies the first order linear relation \(D(k) - 2 D(k - 1) = 0\) and the initial condition \(D(0) = 5\) serves as an initial
condition for <m>D</m>.</p></li>
<li><p> If \(C(k) =3^{k-1}+2^{k+1}+k\) , \(k \geq  0\), quite a bit more algebraic manipulation is required to get our result:

$\quad $\(\begin{array}{cc}
 C(k) =3^{k-1}+2^{k+1}+k &amp; \text{Original} \text{equation} \\
 3C(k-1) =3^{k-1}+3\cdot 2^k+3(k-1) &amp; \text{Substitute} k-1 \text{for} k \text{and} \text{multipy} \text{by} 3 \\
 \text{  } &amp; \text{Subtract} \text{the} \text{second} \text{equation} \text{from} \text{the} \text{first} \\

\end{array}\)

The recurrence relation that we have just obtained, defined for k $\geq $ 2, together with the initial conditions \(C(0) = 7/3\) and \(C(1) = 5\),
define \(C\).We could do more algebra to obtain a third-order linear relation in this case.
</p></li>

</example> 

<p>Table 8.3.1 summarizes our results together with a few other examples that we will let the reader derive. Based on these results, we might conjecture
that any closed form expression for a sequence that combinesexponential expressions and polynomial expressions will be solutions of finite order
linear relations. Not only is this true, but the converse is true: a finite order linear relation defines a closed form expression that is similar
to the ones that were just examined. The only additional information that is needed is a set of initial conditions.</p>

+ C_1S(k - 1) +\ldots + C_n S(k --- n) =0\)
</p></statement><index><main> Homogeneous Recurrence Relation.</main></index></definition>


<example xml:id="ex-first-order-homogeneous-rr"><title>A First Order Homogeneous Recurrence Relations</title><p>\(D(k) - 2D(k - 1) = 0\) is a first-order homogeneous relation. Since it can also be written as \(D(k) =
2D(k --- 1)\), it should be no surprise that it arose from an expression that involves powers of 2 (see Example 8.3.3a). More generally, you would
expect that the solution of \(L(k) - a L(k - 1)\) would involve \(a^k\) . Actually, the solution is \(L(k) = L(0)a^k\) , where the value of \(L(0)\)
is given by the the initial condition.
</p></example>

<example xml:id="ex-second-order-rr"><title>A Second Order Example</title>
<p> Consider the second-order homogeneous relation \(S(k) --- 7S(k - 1) + 12 S(k- 2) = 0\) together with the initial conditions
\(S(0) = 4\) and \(S(1) = 4\). From our discussion above, we can predict that the solution to this relation involves terms of the form \(b a^k\),
where <m>b</m> and <m>a</m> are nonzero constants that must be determined. If the solution were to equal this quantity exactly, then

\(\quad \quad \quad  \begin{array}{ccc}
 S(k)=b a^k &amp;   &amp;   \\
 S(k-1)=b a^{k-1} &amp; \text{   } &amp; \text{  } \\
 S(k-2)=b a^{k-2} &amp;   &amp;   \\
\end{array}\)



\(\text{Substitute} \text{these} \text{expressons} \text{into} \text{the} \text{recurrence} \text{relation} \text{to} \text{get}\)



\( \quad \quad b a^k-7 b a^{k-1}+12 b a^{k-1}=0\text{                        }(\text{Eq} 8.3a)\)

Each term on the left-hand side of the equation has a factor of \(b a^{k-2}\), which is nonzero. Dividing through by this common factor yields

\( \quad \quada^2 - 7a + 12 = (a - 3) (a - 4) = 0\).(Eq 8.3b)</p>

<p>Therefore, the only possible values of <m>a</m> are 3 and 4. Equation (8.3b) is called the characteristic equation of the recurrence relation.
The fact is that our original recurrence relation is true for any sequence of the form \(S(k) = b_1 3^k + b_24^k\), where \(b_1\) and \(b_2\) are
real numbers. This set of sequences is called the general solution of the recurrence relation. If we didn't have initial conditions for \textit{
S}, we would stop here. The initial conditions make it possible for us to obtain definite values for \(b_1\) and \(b_2\).

$\quad $ \(\left\{
\begin{array}{c}
 S(0)=4 \\
 S(1)=4 \\
\end{array}
\right\}\text{  }\Rightarrow \left\{
\begin{array}{c}
 b_13^0+b_24^0=4 \\
 b_13^1+b_24^1=4 \\
\end{array}
\right\}\text{  }\Rightarrow \left\{
\begin{array}{c}
 b_1+b_2=4 \\
 3b_1+4b_2=4 \\
\end{array}
\right\}\text{  }\)

The solution of this set of simultaneous equations is \(b_1 = 12\) and \(b_2 = -8\) and so the solution is\(S(k) = 12 \cdot 3^k - 8 \cdot 4^k\).

root. If \(a_j\) is a double root, then the \(b_ja_j{}^k\) term is replaced with \(\left(b_{j 0}+b_{j 1}k\right)a_j{}^k\). In general, if \(a_j\)
is a root of multiplicity <m>p</m>, then the \(b_ja_j{}^k\) term is replaced with \(\left(b_{j 0}+b_{j 1}k+\cdots +b_{j(p-1)}k^{p-1}\right)a_j{}^k\).</p></li>

Although this algorithm is valid for all values of <m>n</m>, there are limits to the size of <m>n</m> for which the algorithm is feasible.
Using just a pencil and paper, we can always solve second-order equations. The quadratic formula for the roots of \(a x^2 + b x + c = 0\)is



$\quad \quad \quad \quad $\(x=\frac{-b\pm \sqrt{b^2-4 a c}}{2 a}\)



The solutions of \(a^2+ C_1a + C_2 = 0\) are then



\(\frac{1}{2}\left(-C_1+\sqrt{C_1{}^2-4 C_2}\right)\text{     }\text{and}\text{     }\frac{1}{2}\left(-C_1-\sqrt{C_1{}^2-4 C_2}\right)\)



Although cubic and quartic formulas exist, they are too lengthy to introduce here. For this reason, the only higher-order relations (\(n\geq 3\))
that you could be expected to solve by hand are ones for which there is an easy factorization of the characteristic polynomial.

<example xml:id="ex- 8.3.7."><title> 8.3.7.</title><p></p></example>
 Suppose that <m>T</m> is defined by \(T(k) =7T(k-1)-10T(k-2)\), with , \(T(0) = 4\) and \(T(1) = 17\). We can solve this
recurrence relation with Algorithm 8.3.1:<ol label="a">
<li><p>Note that we had written the recurrence relation in <q>nonstandard</q> form. To avoid errors in this easy step, you might consider a rearrangement
of the equation to, in this case, \(T(k) -7T(k-1)+10T(k-2)=0\).Therefore, the characteristic equation is \(a^2 -7a + 10 = 0\). </p></li>
<li><p> The characteristic roots are\(\frac{1}{2}\left(7+\sqrt{49-40}\right)=5\) and \(\frac{1}{2}\left(7-\sqrt{49-40}\right)=2\). These roots can be
just as easily obtained by factoring the characteristic polynomial into \((a - 5)(a - 2)\).</p></li>
<li><p>The general solution of the recurrence relation is \(T(k) =b_12^k+ b_25^k\) ,</p></li>
<li><p> $\quad $ \(\left\{
\begin{array}{c}
 T(0)=4 \\
 T(1)=17 \\
\end{array}
\right\}\text{  }\Rightarrow \left\{
\begin{array}{c}
 b_12^0+b_25^0=4 \\
 b_12^1+b_25^1=4 \\
\end{array}
\right\}\text{  }\Rightarrow \left\{
\begin{array}{c}
 b_1+b_2=4 \\
 2b_1+5b_2=17 \\
\end{array}
\right\}\text{  }\)

The simulations equations have the solution \(b_1=1\) and \(b_2=3\), Therefore, \(T(k)=2^{k }+3\cdot 5^k\).

Here is one rule that might come in handy: If the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial are all integers, with the constant
term equal to <m>m</m>, then the only possible rational characteristic roots are divisors of <m>m</m> (both positive and negative).

With the aid of a computer (or possibly only a calculator), we can increase <m>n</m>. Approximations of the characteristic roots can be obtained
by any of several well-known methods, some of which are part of standard software packages. There is no general rule that specifies the values of
<m>n</m> for which numerical approximations will be feasible. The accuracy that you get will depend on the relation that you try to solve. (See
Exercise 17 of this section.)

<example xml:id="ex- 8.3.8."><title> 8.3.8.</title><p></p></example>

<li><p> The characteristic equation is \(a^3 - 7a + 6 = 0\).</p></li>
<li><p>The only rational roots that we can attempt are \(\pm  1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \text{and} \pm 6\). By checking these, we obtain the three roots 1,

<li><p>The general solution is \(S(k) =b_11^k+b_22^k+b_3(-3){}^k\). The first term can simply be written \(b_1\) .

You can solve this system by elimination to obtain \(b_1=5\), \(b_2=2\), and \(b_3=1\). Therefore,

$\quad $\(S(k) = 5 + 2\cdot 2^k + (-3)^k = 5 + 2^{k+1} + (-3)^k\)

Our algorithm for nonhomogeneous relations will not be as complete as for the homogeneous case. This is due to the fact that different right-hand
sides (f(k)'s) call for different procedures in obtaining a particular solution in Steps (b) and (c).

\pmb{ Algorithm 8.3.2: Algorithm for Solving Nonhomogeneous Finite Order Linear Relations.}

$\quad $\(S(0) = 6 \Rightarrow \text{   }b(-5)^0+ 1.5 = 6\text{   }\Rightarrow \text{    }b\text{  }+ 1.5 = 6\)

Therefore, \(b = 4.5\) and \(S(k) = 4.5(-5)^k + 1.5\).

<example xml:id="ex- 8.3.11."><title> 8.3.11.</title><p></p></example>
 Consider \(T(k) - 7T(k - 1) + 10T(k - 2) = 6 + 8k\) with \(T(0) = 1\) and \(T(1) = 2\).<ol label="a">
<li><p>From Example 8.3.7, we know that \(T^{(h)}(k)=b_12^k+ b_25^k\).Caution:Don't apply the initial conditions to \(T^{(h)}\) until you
add \(T^{(p)}\)!</p></li>
<li><p>Since the right-hand side is a linear polynomial, \(T^{(p)}\) is linear; that is, \(T^{(p)}(k)=d_0+d_1k\).</p></li>
<li><p>Substitutioninto the recurrence relation yields:

\(\left(d_0+d_1k\right)-7\left(d_0+d_1(k-1)\right)+10\left(d_0+d_1(k-2)\right)=6+8k\)

$\quad $\(\Rightarrow  \left(4d_0-13d_1\right)+ \left(4d_1\right)k = 6 + 8 k\)

Two polynomials are equal only if their coefficients are equal. Therefore,



$\quad $ \(\left\{
\begin{array}{c}
 4d_0-13d_1=6 \\
 4d_1=8 \\
\end{array}
\right\}\Rightarrow \left\{
\begin{array}{c}
 d_0=8 \\
 d_1=2 \\
\end{array}
\right\}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Use the general solution \(T(k) =b_12^k+ b_25^k+8+2k\)and the initial conditions to get a final solution:

 $\quad $ \(\left\{
\begin{array}{c}
 T(0)=1 \\
 T(1)=2 \\

\right\}\text{  }\Rightarrow \left\{
\begin{array}{c}
 b_1+ b_2+8=1 \\
 2b_1+5b_2+10=2 \\

\\
\quad \quad \Rightarrow \left\{
\begin{array}{c}
 b_1+b_2=-7 \\
 2b_1+5b_2=-8 \\

\right\}\\
\\
\quad \quad \Rightarrow \left\{
\begin{array}{c}
 b_1=-9 \\
 b_2=2 \\
\end{array}
\right\}\text{  }\)

$\quad $

Therefore,  \(T(k) =-9\cdot 2^k+ 2\cdot 5^k+8+2k\)

\pmb{ A quick note on interest rates: } When a quantity, such as a savings account balance, is increased by some fixed percent, it is most easily
computed with a multipier.In the case of an 8$\%$ increase, the multier is 1.08 because any original amount <m>A</m>, has \(0.08A\) added
to it, so that the new balance is

$\quad $ \(A+0.08A = (1+0.08)A = 1.08 A\).

Another example is that if the interest rate is 3.5$\%$, the multiplier would be 1.035. This presumes that the interest is applied a the end
of year for 3.5$\%$ annual interest, often called \textit{ simple interest}.If the interest is applied monthly, and we assume a simplifed case
where each month has the same length, the multiplier after every month would be\(\left(1+\frac{0.35}{12}\right) \approx  1.0292\).After a
year passes, this multiplier would be applied 12 times, which is the same as multiplying by\(1.0292^{12}\approx 1.3556\). That increase from
1.035 to 1.3556 is the effect of \textit{ compound interest.}

<example xml:id="ex- 8.3.12."><title> 8.3.12.</title><p></p></example>
 Suppose you open a savings account that pays an annual interest rate of 8$\%$. In addition, suppose you decide to deposit
one dollar when you open the account, and you intend to double your deposit each year.Let \(B(k)\) be your balance after <m>k</m> years. \textit{
B} can be described by the relation \(B(k) = 1.08 B(k - 1) + 2^k\), with \(S(0) = 1\). If, instead of doubling the deposit each year, you deposited
a constant amount, <m>q</m>, the \(2^k\) term would be replaced with <m>q</m>, A sequence of regular deposits such as this is called an annuity.

Returning to the original situation, we can obtain a closed form expression for \(B^{(h)}\):<ol label="a">
<li><p>\(B^{(h)}(k)=b_1(1.08){}^k\)</p></li>
<li><p>\(B^{(p)}(k)\) should be of the form \(d 2^k\).</p></li>
<li><p>\(d 2^k = 1.08d 2^{k-1}+2^k\\
\\
\quad \Rightarrow \text{  }(2d) 2^{k-1} = 1.08d 2^{k-1}+ 2\cdot 2^{k-1}\\
\\
\quad \Rightarrow  2d = 1.08 d + 2\\
\\
\quad \Rightarrow \text{  }.92d = 2 \\
\\
\quad \Rightarrow \text{   }d= 2.174\text{  }(\text{to} \text{the} \text{nearest} \text{thousandth})\)

$\quad $Therefore \(B^{(p)}(k)=2.174\cdot  2^k\)</p></li>
<li><p> \(B(0) = 1 \Rightarrow \text{   }b_1+2.174 = 1\\
\\
\text{$\quad $     }\Rightarrow \text{   }b_1= -1.174\)

 \(B(k) = -1.174\cdot  1.08^k+ 2.174\cdot  2^k\).

 Find the general solution to \(S(k) - 3 S(k - 1) - 4 S(k - 2) = 4^k\).<ol label="a">
<li><p>The characteristic roots of the associated homogeneous relation are -1 and 4. Therefore, \(S^{(h)}(k)=b_1(-1){}^k+ b_2 4^k\).</p></li>
<li><p>A function of the form \(d 4^k\) will not be a particular solution of the nonhomogeneous relation since it solves the associated homogeneous
relation. When the right-hand side involves an exponential function with a base that equals a characteristic root,you should multiply your guess
at a particular solution by <m>k</m>. Our guess at \(S^{(p)}(k)\) would then be \(d k 4^k\) . See below for a more complete description of this
procedure.</p></li>
<li><p>Substitute \(d k 4^k\) into the recurrence relation for \(S(k)\):



$\quad $\(d k 4^k-3d (k-1) 4^{k-1}-4d (k-2) 4^{k-2}=4^k\\
\\
16d k 4^{k-2}-12d (k-1) 4^{k-2}-4d (k-2) 4^{k-2}=4^k\)

Each term on the left-hand side has a factor of \(4^{k-2}\) 

 $\quad $ \(\text{I6} d k - 12d(k - 1) - 4d(k - 2) = 4^220 d = 16\text{   }\Rightarrow \text{   }d=0.8\)

Therefore, \(S^{(p)}(k) = 0.8 k\text{  }4^4\)</p></li>
<li><p>The general solution to the recurrence relation is

$\quad \quad $\(S(k) =b_1(-1){}^k+ b_2 4^k +0.8 k 4^k\)

If the right-hand side of a nonhomogeneous relation involves an exponential with base <m>a</m>, and <m>a</m> is also a characteristic root
of multiplicity <m>p</m>, then multiply your guess at a particular solution as prescribed in Table 8,3.2 by \(k^p\) , where <m>k</m> is the
index of the sequence.

<example xml:id="ex- 8.3.14."><title> 8.3.14.</title><p></p></example> <ol label="a">
<li><p> If \(S(k) - 9S(k - 1) + 20 S(k - 2) = 2\cdot 5^k\), the characteristic roots are 4 and 5. \(S^{(p)}(k)\) will takethe form \(d k 5^k\).</p></li>
<li><p> If \(S(n)- 6S(n - 1) + 9 S(n - 2) = 3^{n+1}\) the only characteristic root is 3, but it is a double root (multiplicity 2).Therefore, the
form of the particular solution is \(d n^2 3^n\).</p></li>
<li><p> If \(Q(j)-Q(j-1)-12Q(j-2)=(-3)^j+ 6\cdot 4^j\), the characteristic roots are -3 and 4. The form of the particular solution will
be \(d_1j (-3)^j+ d_2j\cdot 4^j\).</p></li>
<li><p> If \(S(k) - 9S(k - 1) + 8S(k- 2) = 9k + 1 = (9k + 1)1^k\), the characteristic roots are 1 and 8.If the right-hand side is a polynomial,
as it is in this case, then the exponential factor \(1^k\) can be introduced. The particular solution will take the form \(k\left(d_0+ d_1k\right)\).



We conclude this section with a comment on the situation in which the characteristic equation gives rise to complex roots. If we restrict the coefficients
of our finite order linear relations to real numbers, or even to integers, we can still encounter characteristic equations whose roots are complex.
Here, we will simply take the time to point out that our algorithms are still valid with complex characteristic roots, but the customary method for
expressing the solutions of these relations is different. Since an understanding of these representations requires some background in complex numbers,
we will simply suggest that an interested reader can refer to a more advanced treatment of recurrence relations (see also difference equations).

<exercise number="17"><statement>Suppose that <m>C</m> is a small positive number. Consider the recurrence relation \(B(k) - 2B(k - 1) + \left(1 - C ^2\right)B(k --- 2)
= C^2\), with initial conditions \(B(0) = 1\) and \(B(1) = 1\). If <m>C</m> is small enough, we might consider approximating the relation by replacing
\(1 - C^2\) with 1 and \(C^2\) with 0. Solve the original relation and its approximation. Let \(B_a\) a be the solution of the approximation. Compare
closed form expressions for \(B(k)\) and \(B_a(k)\). Their forms are very different because the characteristic roots of the original relation were
close together and the approximation resulted in one double characteristic root.If characteristic roots of a relation
are relatively far apart, this problem will not occur.For example, compare the general solutions of
