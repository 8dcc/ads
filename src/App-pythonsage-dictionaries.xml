<p>In Python and Sage, a dictionary is a convenient data structure for establishing a relationship between sets of data.  From the point of view of this text, we can think of a dictionary as a concrete realization of a relation between two sets or on a single set.  A dictionary resembles a function in that there is a set of data values called the <c>keys</c>, and for each key, there is a <c>value<c>.  The value associated with a key can be almost anything, but it is most commonly a list.  We will illustrate this idea with examples.</p>
<example xml:id="ex-fruit-color-dictionary">
<p>For our first example, we will define a relationship between colors and fruits.  The keys will be a set of colors and values associated with each color will be a list of fruits that can take on that color. We will demonstrate how to initialize the dictionary and how to add to it.  Also we will examine the <q>method</q> that can be used to work with an existing dictionary.</p>
</example>
<sage xml:id="alg-slow-exp">
<input>
def slow_exp(a,m,n):
	b=1
	k=m
	while k>0:
		b=(b*a)%n  # % is integer remainder (mod) operation
		k-=1
	return b
	
slow_exp(2,5,7)
</input>
</sage>

<sage>
<input>
def fast_exp(a,m,n):
	t=a
	b=1
	k=m
	while k>0:
		if k%2==1: b=(b*t)%n
		t=(t^2)%n
		k=k//2  # // is the integer quotient operation
	return b
	
fast_exp(2,5,7)
</input>
</sage>
