<title>Polynomial Rings</title>

<p>In the previous sections we examined the solutions of a few equations over different rings and fields. To solve the equation \(x^2- 2 = 0\) over
the field of the real numbers means to find all solutions of this equation that are in this particular field <m>\mathbb{R}</m>. This statement can be
replaced as follows: Determine all \(a \in  \mathbb{R}\) such that the polynomial \(f(x) = x^2 - 2\) is equal to zero when evaluated at \(x=a\).
 In this section, we will concentrate on  the theory of polynomials. We will develop concepts using the general setting of polynomials over rings
since results proven over rings are true for fields (and integral domains). The reader should keep in mind that in most cases we are just formalizing
concepts that he or she learned in high school algebra over the field of reals.</p>

<notation><usage>R[x]</usage><description>the set of all polynomials in \(x\) over \(R\)</description></notation>
<statement><p>Let \([R; +, \cdot ]\) be a ring.  A polynomial, \(f(x)\), over \(R\) is an expression of the form 
\[f(x)=\sum _{i=0}^n a_i x^i=a_0 + a_1 x+a_2 x^2+ \cdots +a_n x^n\]  where \(n\geq 0\),
and \(a_0, a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \in  R\).  If  \(a_n \neq  0\),  then the degree of \(f(x)\) is \(n\),  If f(x) = 0, then the degree of f(x) is undefined.  If the degree of \(f(x)\) is \(n\), we write \(\deg f(x) = n\). The set of all polynomials in the indeterminate <m>x</m> with coefficients in <m>R</m> is denoted by \(R[x]\).</p></statement></definition>


<remark><ul>
<li><p>The symbol <m>x</m> is an object called an indeterminate, which is not an element of the ring \(R\).  </p></li>
\<li><p>Note that \(R\subseteq  R[x]\), The elements of <m>R</m> are called constant polynomials, with the nonzero elements of <m>R</m> being the polynomials of degree 0.</p></li>
<li><p><m>R</m> is called the ground, or base, ring for \(R[x]\).</p></li>
<li><p>  In the definition above, we have written the terms in increasing degree starting with the constant.  The ordering of terms can be reversed
without changing the polynomial.  For example,  \(1 + 2 x -3x^4\) and  \(-3x^4+2 x+1\) are the same polynomial. </p></li>
<li><p>   A term of the form \(x^k\) in a polynomial is understood to be \(1 x^k\).  </p></li>
</ul></remark>

<example xml:id="ex-some-polynomials"><p> \(f(x) = 3\), \(g(x) = 2 - 4x +7x^2\) , and \(h(x) = 2 + x^4\) are all polynomials in \(\mathbb{Z}[x]\). Their degrees are
0, 2, and 4, respectively.</p></example>



<p>Addition and multiplication of polynomials are performed as in high school algebra. However, we must do our computations in the ground ring of the polynomials.</p>

<example xml:id="ex-polynomial-operations"><p>In \(\mathbb{Z}_3[x]\), if \(f(x) = 1+x\) and  \(g(x) = 2+x\), then
<me>\begin{split}
f(x) + g(x) &amp;= (1+x) + (2+x)\\
		&amp; = \left(1 +_3 2\right)+ \left(1 +_3 1\right) x\\
		&amp;  = 0 + 2x  \\
		&amp; = 2x
\end{split}
</me>


and
<me>\begin{split}
f(x)g(x) &amp;= (1+x) \cdot  (2 +x) \\
		&amp;= (1+x) \cdot  2 + (1+x) \cdot x\\
		&amp;= 1\times _32+2x + 1x+x\cdot x\\
		&amp;=2 + \left(2 +_3 1\right)x + x^2 \\
		&amp; =2 + x^2
\end{split}
</me>

However, for the same polynomials as above, \(f(x)\) and \(g(x)\) in the more familar setting of <m>\mathbb{Z}</m>[x], we have
<me>f(x) + g(x) = (1+x) + (2+x)  = (1 +2)+ (1 +1) x = 3 + 2x</me>
and
<me>\begin{split}f(x)g(x)\\
		&amp; =(1+x)\cdot(2 +x)\\
		&amp;= (1+x)\cdot 2+(1+x)\cdot x\\
		&amp; = 1\cdot 2+2x + 1x+x\cdot x\\
		&amp;=2 + (2 +1)x + x^2 \\
		&amp; =2 +3x + x^2\\
\end{split}
</me>
</p>
<p>The important fact to keep in mind is that addition and multiplication in \(R[x]\) depends on addition and multiplication in <m>R</m>. The powers of \(x\) merely serve the purpose of <q>place holders.</q> All computations are done over the given ring.  We summarize in the following formal definitions:</p>

<definition xml:id="def-polynomial-addition"><title>Addition in \(R[x]\)</title>
<index><main>Polynomial Addition</main></index>
<statement><p>Let \(f(x) =a_0 + a_1 x+a_2 x^2+ \cdots +a_m x^m\) and \(g(x) =b_0 + b_1 x+b_2 x^2+ \cdots +b_n x^n\)
be elements in R[x] so that \(a_i \in  R\) and \(b_i\in R\)  for all i. Let \(k\) be the maximum of \(m\) and \(n\).  Then  \(f(x) + g(x) =c_0 + c_1 x+c_2 x^2+ \cdots +c_k x^k\), where \(c_i=a_i+b_i\) for \(i = 0, 1, 2, \ldots , k\).</p></statement></definition>



<definition xml:id="def-polynomial-multiplication"><title>Multiplication in \(R[x]\)</title>
<index><main>Polynomial Multiplication</main></index><statement><p>Let \(f(x) =a_0 + a_1 x+a_2 x^2+ \cdots +a_m x^m\) and \(g(x) =b_0 + b_1 x+b_2 x^2+ \cdots +b_n x^n\).  Then
<me>\begin{array}{c}
f(x) \cdot  g(x) = d_0 + d_1 x+d_2 x^2+ \cdots +d_p x^p \quad \textrm{ where } p=m+n \textrm{ and }\\
d_s=\sum_{i=0}^s a_i b_{s-i} =a_0 b_s+a_1 b_{s-1}+a_2 b_{s-2}+\cdots +a_{s-1} b_1+a_s b_0\\
\textrm{for } \(0\leq s\leq p\\\end{array}
</me>
</p></statement></definition>

<example xml:id="ex-polyomial-mult"><p>Let \(f(x) = 2 + x^2\) and \(g(x) = -1 + 4x + 3x^2\). We will compute \(f(x) \cdot  g(x)\) in \(\mathbb{Z}[x]\). Of course
this product can be obtained by the usual methods of high school algebra. We will, for illustrative purposes, use the above definition. Using the
notation of the above definition, \(a_0=2\), \(a_1=0\), \(a_2=1\), \(b_0=-1\), \(b_1= 4\), and \(b_2 = 3\). We want to compute the coefficients \(d_0\),
\(d_1\), \(d_2\), \(d_3\), and \(d_4\) . We will compute \(d_3\) , the coefficient of the \(x^3\) term of the product, and leave the remainder to
the reader (see Exercise 2 of this section).  Since the degrees of both factors is 2, \(a_i= b_i= 0\)  for \(i\geq 3\).



 \(\textrm{             }d_3=a_0 b_3+a_1 b_2+a_2 b_1+a_3b_0\quad =2\cdot 0+0\cdot 3+1\cdot 4+0\cdot (-1)=4\)



From high school algebra we all learned the standard procedure for dividing a polynomial \(f(x)\) by a second polynomial \(g(x)\). This process of
polynomial long division is referred to as the division property for polynomials. Under this scheme we continue to divide until the result is a quotient
\(q(x)\) and a remainder \(r(x)\) whose degree is strictly less than that of the divisor \(g(x)\). This property is valid over any field.</p></example> 

<p>The proofs of the following theorem are not difficult but rather long, so we omit them. </p>

<theorem xml:id="theorem-polynomial-ring-properties"><title>Properties of Polynomial Rings</title><statement>Let \([R, +, \cdot]\) be a ring. Then:</p></li>
<li><p>\(R[x]\) is a ring under the operations of polynomial addition and multiplication, which depend on (are induced by) the operations in \(R\).</p></li>
<li><p>If \(R\) is a commutative ring, then \(R[x]\) is a commutative ring.</p></li>
<li><p>If \(R\) is a ring with unity, \textup{ 1}, then \(R[x]\) is a ring with unity (the unity in \(R[x]\) is \(1 + 0x + 0 x^2 + \cdots\)).</p></li>
<li><p>If \(R\) is an integral domain, then \(R[x]\) is an integral domain.</p></li>
<li><p>If \(F\) is a field, then \(F[x]\) is not a field. However, \(F[x]\) is an integral domain.
</statement></theorem> 
<p>Next we turn to division of polynomials, which is not an operation since the result is a pair of polynomials, not a single one. Before giving a formal decription, we consider some examples.</p>
<example xml:id="ex-poly-division-1"><title>Polynomial Division</title><p>Let \(f(x) = 1 + x + x^3\) and \(g(x) = 1 + x\) be two polynomials in  \(\mathbb{Z}_2[x]\). Let us divide \(f(x)\)
by \(g(x)\). Keep in mind that we are in \(\mathbb{Z}_2[x]\) and that, in particular, \(-1=1\) in \(\mathbb{Z}_2\) .  This is a case where reordering the terms in decreasing degree is preferred.

         <figure xml:id="fig-poly-divison-1">
                <image width="60%" source="images/fig-poly-divison-1.png">
                    <description>fig-poly-divison-1</description>
                </image>
            </figure>
<p>Therefore,
\[\frac{x^3 + x + 1}{x+ 1}= x^2+ x + \frac{1}{x + 1}\]
or equivalently,
\[x^3 + x + 2= \left( x^2+ x\right)\cdot (x+1) + 1\]
That is, \(f(x) = g(x)\cdot q(x) + r(x)\) where \(q(x) = x^2+x\) and \(r(x) = 1\).  Notice that  \(\deg (r(x)) = 0\), which is strictly less than the \(\deg (g(x)) = 1\).
</p></example>
 
<example xml:id="ex-poly-division-2">
<p>Let \(f(x) = 1 +x^4\) and \(g(x) = 1 + x\) be polynomials in \(\mathbb{Z}_2[x]\).  Let us divide f(x) by g(x):

         <figure xml:id="fig-poly-divison-2">
                <image width="60%" source="images/fig-poly-divison-2.png">
                    <description>fig-poly-divison-2</description>
                </image>
            </figure>
Thus \(x^4+ 1 = \left(x^3+x^2+ x + 1\right)(x+1)\text \).

Since we have 0 as a remainder, \(x + 1\) must be a factor of \(x^4+ 1\), as in high school algebra. Also, since \(x + 1\) is a factor of \(x^4 +
1\),  1 is a zero (or root) of \(x^4 + 1\).   Of course we could have determined that 1 is a root of \(f(x)\) simply by computing   \(f(1)
=1^4 +_2 1 = 1 +_2 1 = 0\).
</p></example> 
Before we summarize the main results suggested by the previous examples, we should probably consider what could have happened if we had performed
divisions of polynomials in the ring <m>\mathbb{Z}</m>[x] rather than over the field \(\mathbb{Z}_2\) . For example,\(\text f(x) = x^2 - 1\) and \(g(x)
= 2x - 2\) are both elements of the ring <m>\mathbb{ZQ}</m>[x], yet 


 \(\frac{x^2+ 1}{2x-1}= \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{1}{2}\)

The quotient is not a polynomial over <m>\mathbb{Z}</m> but a polynomial over the field <m>\mathbb{Q}</m>. For this reason it would be wise to describe all results over a field <m>F</m> rather than over an arbitrary ring <m>R</m>.

<theorem xml:id="theorem-poly-divison-property"><title>Division Property for Polynomials </title><index><main>Division Property for Polynomials</main></index><statement>\pmb{ \(F[x]\)}\pmb{ .} Let \([F; +, \cdot ]\) be a field and let \(f(x)\) and \(g(x)\) be two elements
of \(F[x]\) with \(g(x) \neq  0\). Then there exist unique polynomials \(q(x)\) and \(r(x)\) in \(F[x]\) such that \(f(x) = g(x) q(x) + r(x)\), where
\(\deg  r(x) < \deg  g(x)\).</statement><proof>Theorem 16.3.2 can be proven by induction on \(\deg  f(x)\).</proof></theorem>





<theorem xml:id="theorem-16.3.3."><title>16.3.3.</title><index><main>16.3.3.</main></index><statement></statement><proof></proof></theorem> Let \([F; +, \cdot ]\) be a field. An element \(a \in  F\) is a zero of \(f(x) \in  F[x]\) if and only if \(x - a\) is a factor
of \(f(x)\) in \(F[x]\).

Proof: ($\Rightarrow $) Assume that \(a \in  F\) is a zero of \(f(x) \in  F[x]\). We wish to show that \(x - a\) is a factor of \(f(x)\). To do so,
apply the division property to \(f(x)\) and \(g(x) = x - a\). Hence, there exist unique polynomials \(q(x)\) and \(r(x)\) from \(F[x]\) such that
\(f(x) = (x - a)\cdot q(x) + r(x)\) and the \(\deg  r(x) < \deg  (x - a) = 1\), so \(r (x) = c \in  F\), that is, \(r(x)\) is a constant. Also \textit{
a} is a zero of \(f(x)\) mean \(f(a) = 0\).    So  \(f(x) = (x - a)\cdot  q(x) + c\)  becomes \(0 = f(a) = (a - a) q(a) + c\). Hence \(c
= 0\), so \(f(x) = (x - a) \cdot  q(x)\), and \(x - a\) is a factor of \(f(x)\). The reader should note that a critical point of the proof of this
half of the theorem was the part of the division property that stated that \(\deg  r(x) < \deg  g(x)\).

($\Leftarrow $)  We leave this half to the reader, exercise 6. $\blacksquare $

<theorem xml:id="theorem-16.3.4."><title>16.3.4.</title><index><main>16.3.4.</main></index><statement></statement><proof></proof></theorem> A nonzero polynomial \(f(x) \in  F[x]\) of degree n can have at most n zeros.



Proof: Let \(a \in  F\) be a zero of \(f(x)\). Then \(f(x) = (x - a) \cdot  q_1(x)\), \(q_1(x)\in F[x]\), by Theorem 16.3.3. If \(b \in  F\) is a
zero of \(q_1(x)\), then again by Theorem 16.3.3, \(f(x) = (x -a)(x - b)q_2(x)\), \(q_2(x)\in F[x]\). Continue this process, which must terminate
in at most <m>n</m> steps since the degree of \(q_k(x)\) would be \(n-k\). $\blacksquare $



From Theorem 16.3.3 we can obtain yet another insight into the problems associated with solving polynomial equations; that is, finding the zeros
of a polynomial. The theorem states that an element \(a \in  F\) is a zero of \(f(x) \in  F[x]\) if and only if \(x - a\) is a factor of \(f(x)\).
The initial important idea here is that the zero <m>a</m> is from the ground field <m>F</m>. Second, <m>a</m> is a zero only if \((x - a)\)
is a factor of \(f(x)\) in \(F[x]\) $---$that is, only when \(f(x)\) can be factored (or reduced) to the product of \((x - a)\) times some other
polynomial in \(F[x]\).

<example xml:id="ex-16.3.6."><title>16.3.6.</title><p></p></example> Consider the polynomial \(f(x) = x^2-2\) taken as being in <m>\mathbb{ZQ}</m>[x]. From high school algebra we know that \(f(x)\)
has two zeros (or roots), namely \(\pm \sqrt{2}\), and \(x^2 - 2\) can be factored (reduced) as \(\left(x - \sqrt{2}\right) \left(x + \sqrt{2}\right)\).
 However, we are working in \(\mathbb{Q}[x]\), these two factors are not in the set of polynomials over the rational numbers, <m>\mathbb{ZQ}</m>  since
\(\sqrt{2}\notin \mathbb{Q}\) .   Therefore, \(x^2 - 2\) does not have a zero in <m>\mathbb{ZQ}</m> since it cannot be factored over <m>\mathbb{ZQ}</m>. When
this happens, we say that the polynomial is irreducible over <m>\mathbb{ZQ}</m>.



The problem of factoring polynomials is tied hand-in-hand with that of the reducibility of polynomials. We give a precise definition of this concept.

<definition xml:id="def-Irreducible over F."><title>Irreducible over F.</title><index><main>Irreducible over F.</main></index><notation><usage></usage><description></description></notation><statement><p></p></statement></definition>

 Let[F, +, $\cdot $] be a field and let f(x) $\in $ F[x] be a nonconstant polynomial, f(x)) is  irreducible
over F if and only if  f(x) cannot be expressed as a product of two (or more) polynomials, both from F[x] and both of degree lower than that of
f(x).



A polynomial is reducible.  over.  <m>F</m> if it is not irreducible over <m>F</m>.

<example xml:id="ex-16.3.7."><title>16.3.7.</title><p></p></example> The polynomial \(f(x) = x^4 + 1\) of Example 16.3.5 is reducible over \textrm{ \(\mathbb{Z}_2\)} since \(x^4 + 1 = (x + 1)\left(x^3
+ x^2 + x - 1\right).\)

<example xml:id="ex-16.3.8. { "><title>16.3.8. { </title><p></p></example>}Is the polynomial \(f(x) = x^3 + x + 1\) of Example 16.3.4 reducible over \(\mathbb{Z}_2\) ? From Example 16.3.4 we know
that \(x + 1\) is not a factor of \(x^3 + x + 1\), and from high school algebra we realize that a cubic (also second-degree) polynomial is reducible
if and only if it has a linear (first-degree) factor. (Why?) Does \(f(x) =x^3 + x + 1\) have any other linear factors? <xref ref="theorem-polynomial-ring-properties" autoname="yes" /> gives us a
quick way of determine this since \(x - a\) is a factor of \(x^3 + x + 1\) over \(\mathbb{Z}_2\) if and only if a $\in $ \(\mathbb{Z}_2\) is a zero
of \(x^3 + x + 1\). So \(x^3 + x + 1\) is reducible over \(\mathbb{Z}_2\) if and only if it has a zero in \(\mathbb{Z}_2\) . Since \(\mathbb{Z}_2\)
has only two elements, 0 and 1, this is easy enough to check. 

 \(f(0) = 0^3 +_2 0+_2 1= 1\)   and 

 \(f(1) =1^3 +_2 1 +_2 1 = 1\)

so neither 0 nor 1 is a zero of \(f(x)\) over \textrm{ \(\mathbb{Z}_2\)} . Hence, \(x^3 + x + 1\) is irreducible over \(\mathbb{Z}_2\).



From high school algebra we know that \(x^3 + x + 1\) has three zeros from some field. Can we find this field? To be more precise, can we construct
(find) the field which contains \(\mathbb{Z}_2\) and all zeros of \(x^3 + x + 1\)? We will consider this task in the next section.



We close this section with a final analogy. Prime numbers play an important role in mathematics. The concept of irreducible polynomials (over a field)
is analogous to that of a prime number. Just think of the definition of a prime number. A useful fact concerning primes is: If <m>p</m> is a prime
and if \(p|a b\), then \(p | a\) or \(p | b\). We leave it to the reader to think about the veracity of the following: If \(p(x)\) is an irreducible
polynomial over <m>F</m>, \(a(x), b(x)\in F[x]\) and \(p(x)|a(x) b(x)\), then \(p(x)|a(x)\) or \(p(x)|b(x)\).
