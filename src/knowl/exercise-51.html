<article class="exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">9</span></h5> (a) Suppose each single character stored in a computer uses eight bits. Then each character is represented by a different sequence of eight 0's and l's called a bit pattern. How many different bit patterns are there? (That is, how many different characters could be represented?)
<p> (b) How many bit patterns are palindromes (the same backwards as forwards)?</p>
<p> (c) How many different bit patterns have an even number of 1's?</p></article><div class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"></div><div class="context-link" style="text-align:right;"><a href="the-rule-of-products.html#exercise-51">(in-context)</a></div>
