</h5>How many ways can we select a set of three letters from  \(A = \{a, b, c, d\}\)?  Note here that we are not concerned with the order of the three letters. By trial and error, abc, abd, acd, and bcd are the only listings possible. To repeat, we were looking for all three-element subsets of the set A. Order is not important in sets. The notation for choosing 3 elements from 4 is most commonly \(\binom{4}{3}\) or occasionally \(C(4,3)\), either of which is read “4 choose 3” or the number of combinations for four objects taken three at a time.</article><div class="context-link" style="text-align:right;"><a href="combinations-and-the-binomial-theorem.html#four-choose-three">(in-context)</a></div>
