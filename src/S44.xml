<p>In Section 4.2, we observed that each of the <xref ref="table-set-laws" autoname="yes" /> labeled 1 through 9 had an analogue 1' through 9'. We notice that each of the laws in one column can be obtained from the corresponding law in the other column by replacing <m>\cup</m> by <m>\cap </m>, <m>\cap </m> by <m>\cup </m>, <m>\emptyset </m> by U, U by <m>\emptyset</m>, and leaving the complement unchanged.</p>

<definition xml:id="def-duality-sets."><title>Duality Principle for Sets.</title><statement> Let S be any identity involving sets and the operations complement, intersection and union, . If S*
is obtained from S by making the substitutions \(\cup  \to  \cap\), \(\cap \to \cup\), \(\emptyset \to U\) , and \(U\to \emptyset\), then the Statement S* is also true and it is called the dual of the Statement S.
</statement></definition>

<example xml:id="ex-dual-example"><title>Example of a dual</title><p> The dual of \((A \cap  B) \cup  \left(A \cap B^c \right) = A\) is \((A\cup B)\cap \left(A\cup B^c\right)=A\).</p></example>



<p>One should not underestimate the importance of this concept. It gives us a whole second set of identities, theorems, and concepts. For example, we can consider the dual of <em>minsets</em> and <em>minset normal form</em> to obtain what is called <em>maxsets</em> and <em>maxset normal form</em>.</p>
