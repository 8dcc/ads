<section xml:id="s-special-matrices"><title>Special Types of Matrices</title>

<p>We have already investigated, in exercises in the previous section, one special type of matrix. That was the  zero matrix, and found that it behaves in matrix algebra 
in an analogous fashion to the real number 0; that is, as the additive identity. We will now investigate the properties of a few other special matrices.</p>

<definition xml:id="def-diagonal-matrix"><title>Diagonal Matrix</title><statement> A square matrix D is called a diagonal matrix if \(d_{i j}\) = 0 whenever \(i \neq  j\).</statement></definition>

<example xml:id="example-diagonal-matrices"><title>Some diagonal matrices</title><statement><p>   \(A = \left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 2 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 5 \\
\end{array}
\right)\), \(B= \left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
 3 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -5 \\
\end{array}
\right)\), and \(I = \left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
\end{array}
\right)\) are all diagonal matrices.
</p></statement></example>

<p>In the example above, the \(3\times 3\) diagonal matrix <m>I</m> whose diagonal entries are all 1's has the distinctive property that for any other \(3\times 3\) matrix <m>A</m> we have \(A I = I A = A\). For example:</p>
<example xml:id="ex-matrix-identity-product"><title>Multiplying by the Identity Matrix</title><statement><p>If \(A = \left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 5 \\
 6 &amp; 7 &amp; -2 \\
 3 &amp; -3 &amp; 0 \\
\end{array}
\right)\), then

\(A I =\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 5 \\
 6 &amp; 7 &amp; -2 \\
 3 &amp; -3 &amp; 0 \\
\end{array}
\right)\) and

\(I A = \left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 5 \\
 6 &amp; 7 &amp; -2 \\
 3 &amp; -3 &amp; 0 \\
\end{array}
\right)\).
</p></statement></example> 
<p>In other words, the matrix <m>I</m> behaves in matrix algebra like the real number 1; that is, as a multiplicative identity. In matrix algebra, the matrix <m>I</m> is called simply the identity matrix. Convince yourself that if A is any \(n\times n\) matrix \(A I = I A = A\).</p>

<definition xml:id="def-identity-matrix"><title>Identity Matrix</title><statement>The \(n\times n\) diagonal matrix <m>I_n</m> whose 
diagonal components are all 1's is called the identity matrix.  If the context is clear, simply <m>I</m>.</statement><notation><usage> I_{n}</usage><description>The <m>n \times n</m> identity matrix</description></notation></definition>

<p>In the set of real numbers we recall that, given a nonzero real number <m>x</m>, there exists a real number <m>y</m> such that \(x y = y x
=1\). We know that real numbers commute under multiplication so that the two equations can be summarized as \(x y = 1\). Further we know that \(y =x^{-1}= \frac{1}{x}\). Do we have an analogous situation in \(M_{n\times n}(\mathbb{R})\)? Can we define the multiplicative inverse of an \(n\times n\) matrix <m>A</m>? It seems natural to imitate the definition of multiplicative inverse in the real numbers.</p>

<definition xml:id="def-matrix-inverse"><title>Matrix Inverse</title><statement> Let A be an \(n\times n\) matrix. If there exists 
an \(n\times n\) matrix B such that \(A B = B A =I\), then B is a multiplicative inverse of A (called simply an inverse of A) and is denoted by \(A^{-1}\)</statement><notation><usage>A^{-1}</usage><description><m>A</m> inverse, the multiplicative inverse of <m>A</m></description></notation></definition>
<p>When we are doing computations involving matrices, it would be helpful to know that when we find \(A^{-1}\), the answer we 
obtain is the only inverse of the given matrix.  This would let us refer to <em>the</em> inverse of a matrix.  We refrained from saying that in the definition, but the theorem below justifies it. </p>
<p>Remark: Those unfamiliar with the laws of matrices should go over the proof of Theorem 5.4.1 after they have familiarized themselves with the Laws of Matrix Algebra in Section 5.5.</p>
<theorem xml:id="theorem-unique-inverse"><title>Inverses are unique</title><statement><p>The inverse of an \(n\times n\) matrix A, when it exists, is unique.</p></statement><proof><p>Let <m>A</m> be an \(n\times n\) matrix. Assume to the contrary, that <m>A</m> has two (different) inverses, say <m>B</m> and <m>C</m>. Then

</proof></theorem>

<p>Let \(A =\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
 2 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 3  \\
\end{array}
\right)\) .  What is \(A^{-1}\) ? Without too much difficulty, by trial and error, we determine that \(A^{-1}= \left(
\begin{array}{cc}
 \frac{1}{2} &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; \frac{1}{3} \\
\end{array}
\right)\) . This might lead us to guess that the inverse is found by taking the reciprocal of all nonzero entries of a matrix. Alas, it isn't
that easy!</p>
<p>If \(A =\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
 1 &amp; 2 \\
 -3 &amp; 5 \\
\end{array}
\right)\) , the <q>reciprocal rule</q> would tell us that the inverse of <m>A</m> is \(B=\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
 1 &amp; \frac{1}{2} \\
 \frac{-1}{3} &amp; \frac{1}{5} \\
\end{array}
\right)\). Try computing \(A B\) and you will see that you don't get the identity matrix.  So, what <em>is</em> \(A^{-1}\)? In order to understand more completely the notion of the inverse of a matrix, it would be beneficial to have a formula that would enable us to compute the inverse of at least a \(2\times 2\) matrix. To do this, we introduce the definition of the determinant of a \(2\times 2\) matrix. Appendix A gives a more complete description of the determinant of a \(2\times 2\) and higher-order matrices.</p>

<definition xml:id="determinant-2by2"><title>Determinant of a 2 by 2 Matrix</title><statement> Let \(A =\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
 a &amp; b \\
 c &amp; d \\
\end{array}
\right)\). The determinant of A is the number \(\det  A = a d - b c\).</statement><notation><usage>\det A\textrm{ or }\lvert A \rvert</usage><description>The determinant of <m>A</m></description></notation></definition>
<p>In addition to \(\det  A\), common notation for the determinant of matrix <m>A</m>is \(\lvert A \rvert\).  This is particularly common when writing outthe whole matrix, which case we would write \(\left|
\begin{array}{cc}
 a &amp; b \\
 c &amp; d \\
\end{array}
\right|\) for the determinant of the general \(2 \times 2\) matrix.</p>

 1 &amp; 2 \\
 -3 &amp; 5 \\
\end{array}
\right)\)  then \(\det  A = 1\cdot 5 -2\cdot  (-3)=11\). 

If \(B =\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
 1 &amp; 2 \\
 2 &amp; 4 \\
\end{array}
\right)\)  then \(\det  B = 1\cdot 4 -2\cdot 2=0\)

\begin{array}{cc}
 d &amp; -b \\

<example xml:id="ex-finding-inverses"><title>Finding Inverses</title><statement><p>Can we find the inverses of the matrices in <xref ref="ex-some-determinants" autoname="yes" />? 

If \(A =\left(
\begin{array}{cc}

<me>A^{-1}= \frac{1}{11}\left(

 \frac{3}{11} &amp; \frac{1}{11} \\
\end{array}

The reader should verify that \(A A^{-1}=A^{-1}A = I\).</p>

<p>The second matrix, <m>B</m> has a determinant equal to zero. We we tried to apply the formula in <xref ref="theorem-inverse-two-by-two" autoname="yes" />, we would be dividing by zero.
For this reason, the formula can't be applied and in fact \(B^{-1}\) does not exist. 
</p></statement></example>
<p>Remarks:</p>

<ul>
<li> In general, if <m>A</m> is a \(2\times 2\) matrix and if \(\det  A = 0\), then \(A^{-1}\) does not exist.</li>
<li> A formula for the inverse of \(n\times n\) matrices \(n\geq  3\) can be derived that also involves \(\det  A\), Hence, in general, if the determinant of a matrix is zero, the matrix does not have an inverse. However the formula for even a \(3 \times  3\) matrix is very long and is not the most efficient way to compute the inverse of a matrix.</li>
<li> In Chapter 12 we will develop a technique to compute the inverse of a higher-order matrix, if it exists.</li>
<li> Matrix inversion comes first in the hierarchy of matrix operations; therefore, \(A B^{-1}\) is \(A (B^{-1})\).</li>

{Proof}: \(\left(B^{-1}A^{-1}\right)(AB)\)\(=\left(B^{-1}\right)\left(A^{-1}(AB)\right)\)\\
     \(\left.= \left(B^{-1}\right) \left(\left(A^{-1} A\right) B\right)\right)\)\\
