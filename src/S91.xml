<title>Graphs - General Introduction</title>

<p>Recall that we introduced directed graphs in Chapter 6 as a tool to visualize relations on a set.  Here is a formal definition.</p>

<definition xml:id="def-simple-directed-graph"><title>Simple Directed Graph</title><index><main>Graph</main><sub>Simple Directed</sub></index>
<statement><p> A simple directed graph consists of a nonempty <term>set of vertices</term>, <m>V</m>, and a <term>set of edges</term>, <m>E</m>, that is a subset of the set \(V \times V\)).  </p></statement></definition>

<note><title>Some Terminology and Comments</title><p>Each edge is an ordered pair of elements of from the vertex set.  
The first entry is the <term>initial vertex</term> of the edge and the second entry is the <term>terminal vertex</term>. Despite the set terminology in this definition, we often think of a graph as a picture, an aid in visualizing a situation. In Chapter 6, we introduced
this concept to help understand relations on sets. Although those relations were principally of a mathematical nature, it remains true that when
we see a graph, it tells us how the elements of a set are related to one another.</p></note>


<example xml:id="ex-9-1"><title>A Simple Directed Graph</title><p><xref ref="fig-directed-graph-ex1" autoname="yes"/> is an example of a simple directed graph. In set terms, this graph is \((V, E)\), where \(V = \{s, a, b\}\) and \(E = \{(s, a), (s, b), (a, b), (b, a), (b,b)\}\). Note how each edge is labeled either 0 or 1. There are often reasons for labeling even simple graphs. Some labels are to help make a graph easier to discuss; others are more significant We will discuss the significance of the
labels on this graph later.</p>

</example>
<p>In certain cases there may be a need for more than one edge between two vertices, and we need to expand the class of directed graphs.</p>

<definition xml:id="def-multigraph"><title>Multigraph.</title><index><main> Multigraph</main></index><index><main>Multigraph</main></index><statement><p>
 A multigraph is a set of vertices <m>V</m> with a set of edges that can contain more than one edge between the vertices.</p></statement></definition>

<p>One important point to keep in mind is that if we identify a graph as being a multigraph, it isn't necessary that there are two or more edges between some of the vertices.  It is only just <em>allowed</em>. In other words, every simple graph is a multigraph. This is analogous to how a rectangle is a more general geometric figure than a square, but a square is still considered a rectangle.</p>


<example xml:id="ex-multigraph-9-1"><title>A Multigraph</title><p> A Multigraph. A common occurrence of a multigraph is a road map. The cities and towns on the map can be thought of as vertices, while the roads are the edges. It is not uncommon to have more than one road connecting two cities. In order to give clear travel directions, we name or number roads so that there is no ambiguity. We use the same method to describe the edges of the multigraph in <xref ref="fig-multigraph-ex1" autoname="yes"/>. There is no question
what \(\textrm{e3}\) is; however, referring to the edge \((2, 3)\) would be ambiguous.

</example>




<p>There are cases where the order of the vertices is not significant and so we use a different mathematical model for this situation:</p>

<definition xml:id="def-undirected-graph"><title>Undirected Graph</title><index><main>Undirected Graph. </main></index><notation><usage></usage><description></description></notation>
<statement><p>An undirected graph consists of a set <m>V</m>, called a vertex set, and a set <m>E</m> of two-element subsets of <m>V</m>, called the edge set. The two-element subsets are drawn as lines connecting the vertices.</p></statement></definition>






<example xml:id="ex-9-1-2"><title>An Undirected Graph</title><p>A network of computers can be described easily using a graph.  <xref ref="fig-undirected-1" autoname="yes"/> describes a network of five
computers, <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, <m>c</m>, <m>d</m>, and <m>e</m>. An edge between any two vertices indicates that direct two-way communication
is possible between the two computers. Note that the edges of this graph are not directed. This is due to the fact that the relation that is being
displayed is symmetric (i.e., if <m>X</m> can communicate with <m>Y</m>, then <m>Y</m> can communicate with <m>X</m>). Although directed
edges could be used here, it would simply clutter the graph.</p>

<p>This undirected graph, in set terms,  is \(V = \{a, b, c, d, e\}\) and \(E = \{\{a, b,\}, \{a, d\}, \{b, c\}, \{b, d\}, \{c, e\}, \{b, e\}\}\).</p> 
<p>There are several other situations for which this graph can serve as a model. One of them is to interpret the vertices as cities and the edges as roads, an abstraction of a map such as the one in <xref ref="fig-undirected-2" autoname="yes"/> . Another interpretation is as an abstraction of the floor plan of a house.  See <xref ref="exercise-house-9-1" autoname="yes"/>. Vertex <m>a</m> represents the outside of the house; all others represent rooms. Two vertices are connected if there is a door between
them. </p>

<statement><p>A complete undirected graph of <m>n</m> vertices is an undirected graph with the property that each pair of distinct vertices are connected to one another. Such a graph is usually denoted by \(K_n\).</p></statement></definition>

<p>At the start of the problem-solving process, we are at the vertex labeled <q>Start</q> and at the end (if we are lucky enough to have solved the
problem) we will be at the vertex labeled <q>End.</q> The sequence of vertices that we pass through as we move from <q>Start</q> to <q>End</q>
is called a path. The <q>Start</q> vertex is called the initial vertex of the path, while the <q>End</q> is called the final, or terminal, vertex.
Suppose that the problem is solved after two attempts; then the path that was taken is \(\text{Start}, R, A, Q, L, A, Q, \text{End}\). An alternate
path description would be to list the edges that were used: \(1, 2, 3, \text{No}, 4, 3, \text{Yes}\). This second method of describing a path has
the advantage of being applicable for multigraphs. On the graph in Figure 9.1.5, the vertex list \(1,2,3,4,3\) does not clearly describe a path between
1 and 3, but \(e_1,e_4, e_6, e_7\) is unambiguous.</p>
</example>






<note><title>>A Summary of Path Notation and Terminology</title>
<p>If <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are two vertices of a graph, then a <term>path</term> between <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> describes a motion from <m>x</m> and
<m>y</m> along edges of the graph. Vertex <m>x</m> is called the initial vertex of the path and <m>y</m> is called the terminal vertex.
A path between <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> can always be described by its  edge list, the list of edges that were used: \(\left(e_1, e_2,
\ldots , e_n\right)\), where : (1) the initial vertex of \(e_1\) is <m>x</m>; (2) the terminal vertex of \(e_i\) is the initial vertex of \(e_{i+1}\), \(i = 1, 2, \ldots , n - 1\); and (3) the terminal vertex of \(e_n\) is <m>y</m>. The number of edges in the edge list is the <term>path length</term>. A path on a simple graph can also be described by a vertex list. A path of length <m>n</m> will have a list of \(n + 1\) vertices
\(v_0=x\), \(v_1\), \(v_2,\ldots ,v_n=y\), where, for \(k = 0,1,2,\ldots , n-1\), \(\left(v_k,v_{k+1}\right)\) is an edge on the graph. A <term>
circuit</term> is a path that terminates at its initial vertex.</p>
<p>Suppose that a path between two vertices has an edge list \((e_1, e_2 , . . . ,e_n)\). A <term>subpath</term> of this graph is any portion of the path described by one or more consecutive edges in the edge list. For example, \((3, \textrm{No}, 4)\) is a subpath of \((1,2,3, \textrm{No}, 4, 3, \text{Yes})\).  Any path is its own subpath; however, we call it an improper subpath of itself. All other nonempty subpaths are called proper subpaths.</p>



<p>A path or circuit is  simple if it contains no proper subpath that is a circuit. This is the same as saying that a path or circuit is simple
if it does not visit any vertex more than once except for the common initial and terminal vertex in the circuit. In the problem-solving method described in <xref ref="fig-labeled-graph-9-1" autoname="yes"/>, the path that you take is simple only if you reach a solution on the first try.</p>

<p>The leadership structure of a corporation is often represented with a graph as in <xref ref="fig-organization-9-1" autoname="yes"/> </p>

<p>The principle behind such a structure is that everyone but the president has a single immediate supervisor. Any action that anyone takes can reach
the president only through a unique <q>chain of command.</q> This chain-of-command property is characteristic of a special type of graph called
a  tree. Note that the edges of this graph are not directed, but, as in a Hasse diagram, the relation between two connecting vertices is
clear: the top vertex is the supervisor of the lower vertex.</p>

<p>The process of structured (or top-down) problem solving results in a graph that is similar to this tree. Starting with the top of the tree, which
would represent the whole problem, the problem is divided into a sequence of separate subproblems. Each subproblem is divided further into smaller
sub-problems in the same way until the solutions of the lowest problems are easy enough to recognize.
</p></example>
 

<p>From the examples we've see so far, we can see that although a graph can be defined, in short, as a collection of vertices and edges, an integral part of most graphs is the labeling of the vertices and edges that allows us to interpret the graph as a model for some situation. We continue with a few more examples to illustrate this point.</p>

<example xml:id="ex-string-model-9-1"><title>A Graph as a Model for a Set of Strings</title><p>Suppose that you would like to mechanically describe the set of strings of 0's and
1's having no consecutive 1's. One way to visualize a string of this kind is with the graph in <xref ref="fig-directed-graph-ex1" autoname="yes"/>. Consider any path starting at vertex <m>s</m>. If the label on each graph is considered to be the output to a printer, then the output will have no consecutive 1's. For example, the path that is described by the vertex list \((s,a, b, b, a, b, b, a, b)\) would result in an output of \(10010010\). Conversely, any string with  no consecutive 1's determines a path starting at s.
</p></example>

<example xml:id="ex-tournament-graph-9-1"><title>A Tournament Graph.</title><p>Suppose that four teams compete in a round-robin sporting event; that is, each team meets every other team
once, and each game is played until a winner is determined. If the teams are named A, B, C, and D, we can define the relation \(\beta\) on the set
of teams by \(X \beta  Y\) if <m>X</m> beat <m>Y</m>. For one set of results, the graph of \(\beta\) might look like <xref ref="fig-tournament-graph-9-1" autoname="yes"/>.</p>

<p>There are many types of tournaments and they all can be modeled by different types of graphs.</p>

<statement><ol label="a">
<li><p> A tournament graph is a directed graph with the property that no edge connects a vertex to itself, and between any two vertices there is at most one edge.</p></li>
<li><p>A complete (or round-robin) tournament graph is a tournament graph with the property that between any two distinct vertices there is exactly
one edge</p></li>
<li><p>A single-elimination tournament graph is a tournament graph with the properties that: (i) one vertex (the champion) has no edge terminating
at it and at least one edge initiating from it; (ii) every other vertex is the terminal vertex of exactly one edge; and (iii) there is a path from
the champion vertex to every other vertex.</p></li>

<p>Next, we establish the relation <q>is isomorphic to,</q> a form of equality on graphs. The graphs in <xref ref="fig-isomorphic-graphs-9-1" autoname="yes"/> obviously share some similarities, such as the number of vertices and the number of edges. It happens that they are even more similar than just that. If the letters a, b, c, and d in left graph are replaced with the numbers 1,3,4, and 2, respectively, and the vertices are moved around so that they have the same position as the graph on the right, you get the graph on the right.</p>

E\) if and only if \(\left(f\left(v_i\right),f\left(v_j\right)\right)\in E'\). For multigraphs, we add that the number of edges connecting \(v_i\)
to \(v_j\), must equal the number of edges from \(f\left(v_i\right)\) to \(f\left(v_j\right)\).</p></statement></definition>
