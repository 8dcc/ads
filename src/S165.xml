<title>Power Series</title>

Earlier in this chapter, we found that a polynomial of degree <m>n</m> over a ring <m>R</m>  is an expression of the form
\[f(x)=\sum_{i=0}^n a_i x^i=a_0 + a_1 x+a_2 x^2+ \cdots +a_n x^n\)  ,  \(n\geq 0\],
where each of the \(a_i\) are elements of <m>R</m> and \(a_n\neq 0\). In Section 8.5 we defined a generating function of a sequence <m>s</m>
with terms \(s_0\), \(s_1\), \(s_2, \ldots\), $\ldots $  as the infinite sum
\[G(s,z)= \sum_{i=0}^{\infty } s_i z^i=s_0 + s_1 z+s_2 z^2+ \cdots\]</p>
<p>The main difference between these two expressions, disregarding notation, is that the latter is an infinite expression and the former is a finite
expression. In this section we will extend the algebra of polynomials to the algebra of infinite expressions like \(G(s, z)\),  which are called power series.</p>

<statement><p>Let \([R; +,\cdot ]\) be a ring. A power series over R is an expression of the form
\[f(x)=\sum_{i=0}^{\infty } a_i x^i=a_0 + a_1 x+a_2 x^2+ \cdots\] 
where \(a_1, a_2, a_3,\ldots \in  R\).  The set of all such expressions is denoted by \(R[[x]]\).</p></statement>
</definition>

 <p>Our first observation in our comparison of \(R[x]\) and \(R[[x]]\) is that every polynomial is a power series and so \(R[x]\subseteq R[[x]]\). This is true because a polynomial \(a_0 + a_1 x+a_2 x^2+ \cdots +a_n x^n\) of degree <m>n</m> in \(R[x]\), can be thought of as an infinite expression
where \(a_i=0\) for \(i > n\).  In addition, we will see that \(R[[x]]\) is a ring with subring \(R[x]\). </p>

<p>\(R[[x]]\) is given a ring structure by defining addition and multiplication on power series as we did in \(R[x]\), with the modification that, since
we are dealing with infinite expressions, the sums and products will remain infinite expressions that we can determine term by term, as was done in with polynomials.</p>

<example xml:id="ex-16.5.1."><title>Some Power Series Calcuations</title><p>(Example 8.5.3, Revisited.) Let \(f(x)=\sum_{i=0}^{\infty } i x^i=0 + 1 x+2 x^2+3x^3+ \cdots\)  



and

$\quad \quad $ \(g(x)=\sum_{i=0}^{\infty } 2^i x^i=1 +2 x+4 x^2+8x^3+ \cdots\)  



be elements in \(\mathbb{Z}[[x]]\).  Let us compute \(f(x) + g(x)\) and \(f(x)\cdot g(x)\).  First the sum:



 \(f(x) + g(x) =\sum_{i=0}^{\infty } i x^i+\sum_{i=0}^{\infty } 2^i x^i=\sum_{i=0}^{\infty } \left(i+2^i\right) x^i\\
\\
\quad \quad =1+3x+6x^2+11x^3+ \cdots\)



The product is a bit more involved:



 \(\textrm{            }f(x)\cdot g(x) =\left(\sum_{i=0}^{\infty } i x^i\right)\left(\sum_{i=0}^{\infty } 2^i x^i\right)\quad \quad =\left(0

1)x^2+ \cdots \quad \quad = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty } d_i x^i\)



where



$\quad \quad $\(d_i= \sum_{j=0}^i a_j b_{i-j}= \sum_{j=0}^i j 2^{i-j}\)



For example,



$\quad \quad $\(\textrm{             }d_3= 0 \cdot  2^3+ 1 \cdot 2^2+ 2\cdot 2^1+3\cdot 2^0\quad =0+4+4+3\quad =11\)



Hence,



\(f(x)\cdot g(x) =x + 4x^2+11x^3+ \cdots\)

</p></example> 

The First few terms of the product do not suggest a pattern but with Mathematica. , we can get a closed form expression for the coefficients.

\begin{doublespace}
\noindent\(\pmb{\textrm{ Simplify}\left[\sum_{j=0}^i j 2^{i-j}\right]}\)
\end{doublespace}

\begin{doublespace}
\noindent\(-i+2^{i+1}-2\)
\end{doublespace}



Therefore,   \(d_i=2^{i+1}-i-2\) and 



 \(\textrm{            }f(x)\cdot g(x) =\left(\sum_{i=0}^{\infty } i x^i\right)\left(\sum_{i=0}^{\infty } 2^i x^i\right)\quad \quad = \sum
_{i=0}^{\infty } \left(2^{i+1}-i-2\right) x^i\)



<p>We have seen that addition and multiplication in \(R[[x]]\) is virtually identical to that in \(R[x]\). The following theorem parallels <xref ref="theorem-polynomial-ring-properties" autoname="yes" />, establishing the ring properties of \(R[[x]]\).</p>

<theorem xml:id="theorem-power-series-properties"><title>Properties of Power Series</title><statement>Let [R, +, $\cdot $] be a ring. Then:</p></li>
<li><p>\(R[[x]]\) is a ring under the operations of power series addition and multiplication, which depend on (are induced by) the operations in R.</p></li>
<li><p>If R is a commutative ring, then \(R[[x]]\) is a commutative ring.</p></li>
<li><p>If R is a ring with unity, \textup{ 1}, then \(R[[x]]\) is a ring with unity (the unity in R[x] is \(1 + 0x + 0 x^2 + \cdots\)).</p></li>

<li><p>If F is a field, then \(F[[x]]\) is not a field. However, \(F[[x]]\) is an integral domain.
</statement><proof></proof></theorem> 


<p>We are most interested in the situation when the set of coefficients is a field. Theorem 16.5.1  indicates that when F is a field, \(F[[x]]\) is
an integral domain. A reason that \(F[[x]]\) is not a field is the same as one that we can cite for F[x], namely that <m>x</m> does not have multiplicative
inverse in \(F[[x]]\).</p>

<p>With all of these similarities, one might wonder it the rings of polynomials and power series over a field are isomorphic.  It turns out that they are not. The difference between \(F[x]\) and \(F[[x]]\) become apparent when one studies which elements are units (i.e., elements that have multiplicative
inverses) in each. First we prove that the only units in \(F[x]\) are the nonzero constants; that is, the nonzero elements of <m>F</m>.  Compare that fact with the following theorem.</p>

<theorem xml:id="theorem-16.5.2."><title>16.5.2.</title><index><main>16.5.2.</main></index><statement></statement><proof></proof></theorem> Let \([F; +, \cdot ]\) be afield, f(x) is a unit in F[x] if and only f(x) is a nonzero element of F.

Proof: ($\Rightarrow $) Let \(f(x)\) be a unit in \(F[x]\). Then \(f(x)\) has a multiplicative inverse, call it \(g(x)\), such that \(f(x) \cdot
 g(x) = 1\). Hence, the \(\deg  (f(x)\cdot  g(x)) = \deg  (1) = 0\). But \(\deg  (f(x)\cdot  g(x)) = \deg  f(x) + \deg  g(x)\). So \(\deg  f(x) +
\deg  g(x) = 0\), and since the degree of a polynomial is always nonnegative, this can only happen when the \(\deg  f(x) = \deg  g(x) = 0\). Hence,
\(f(x)\) is a constant, an element of <m>F</m>, which is a unit if and only if it is nonzero.

 ($\Leftarrow $) If \(f(x)\) is a nonzero element of <m>F</m>, then it is a unit since <m>F</m> is a field.  Thus it has an inverse, which
is also in \(F[x]\) and so \(f(x)\) is a unit of \(F[x]\). $\blacksquare $



Before we proceed to categorize the units in \(F[[x]]\), we remind the reader that two power series \(a_0 + a_1 x+a_2 x^2+ \cdots\) and \(b_0 + b_1
x+b_2 x^2+ \cdots\) are equal if and only if corresponding coefficients are equal, \(a_i=b_i \textrm{ for} \textrm{ all} \textrm{ \textit{$i$}}\textrm{ \textit{$\geq
$}}\textrm{ \textit{$0$}}\).

<theorem xml:id="theorem-16.5.3."><title>16.5.3.</title><index><main>16.5.3.</main></index><statement></statement><proof></proof></theorem> Let \([F; +, \cdot ]\) be a field. Then \(f(x)=\sum_{i=0}^{\infty } a_i x^i\) is a unit of \(F[[x]]\)  if and only if \(a_0\neq
0\).

Proof: ($\Rightarrow $) If \(f(x)\) is a unit of \(F[[x]]\), then there exists  \(g(x)=\sum_{i=0}^{\infty } b_i x^i\) in \(F[[x]]\) such that


$\quad \quad $\(f(x)\cdot g(x)=\left(a_0 + a_1 x+a_2 x^2+ \cdots \right)\cdot \left(b_0 + b_1 x+b_2 x^2+ \cdots \right)\\
\\
\quad \quad =1\\
\\
\quad \quad = 1 + 0x + 0x^2+ \cdots\)

Since corresponding coefficients in the equation above must be equal, \(a_0\cdot b_0=1\), which implies that \(a_0\neq 0\). 

($\Leftarrow $) Assume that \(a_0\neq 0\). To prove that\(f(x)\) is a unit of \(F[[x]]\) we need to find \(g(x)=\sum_{i=0}^{\infty } b_i x^i\) in
\(F[[x]]\) such that 

$\quad \quad $\(f(x) \cdot  g(x) =\sum_{i=0}^{\infty } d_i x^i= 1\). 

If we use the formula for the coefficients \(d_0\), \(d_1\), \(d_2\), $\ldots $ of  \(f(x) \cdot g(x)\) and equate coefficients, we will obtain

\(d_0= a_0\cdot  b_0= 1\\
\\
d_1= a_0b_1+ a_1b_0=0\\
\\
d_2=a_0 b_2+a_1 b_1+a_2 b_0\vdots \\
\\
d_s= a_0b_s+ a_1b_{s-1}+ \cdots +a_sb_0\\
\\
\textrm{          }\vdots\)

Therefore, the existence of \(g(x)\) is equivalent to the existence of a solution \(b_0\), \(b_1\), \(b_2\), $\ldots $, to the above system of equations.
Since \(a_0\neq 0\), we can solve the first equation for \(b_0\). Then we can continue to the second equation and solve for \(b_1\), then \(b_2\)
can be found by solving the third equation, etc.  Hence,

\(b_0=a_0{}^{-1}\\
\\
b_1= -a_0{}^{-1}\left(a_1b_0\right)\\
\\
b_1=-a_0{}^{-1}\left(a_1b_1+ a_2b_0\right)\\
\\
\quad \vdots \\
\\
b_s= -a_0{}^{-1}\left(a_1b_{s-1}+ a_2b_{s-2}+ \cdots +a_sb_0\right)\\
\\
\quad \vdots\)

Therefore the powers series \(\sum_{i=0}^{\infty } b_i x^i\) is an expression whose coefficients lie in \(F\) and that satisfies the statement \(f(x)
\cdot  g(x) = 1\). Hence, \(g(x)\) is the multiplicative inverse of \(f(x)\) and \(f(x)\) is a unit..



<example xml:id="ex-16.5.2."><title>16.5.2.</title><p></p></example> Let



$\quad \quad $\(\textrm{       }f(x) =1 + 2x + 3 x^2+ 4 x^3+ \cdots \quad =\sum_{i=0}^{\infty } (i+1) x^i\)



be an element of \(\mathbb{Q}[[x]]\). Then, by Theorem 16.5.3, since \(a_0=1\neq 0\),  \(f(x)\) is a unit and has an inverse, call it \(g(x)\).
To compute \(g(x)\), we follow the procedure outlined in  Theorem 16.5.3 .  Using the formulas for the \(b_i'\)s, we obtain



\(b_0 = 1\\
\\
b_1= -1(2\cdot 1)=-2\\
\\
b_2= -1(2\cdot (-2)+ 3\cdot 1) = 1\\
\\
b_3= -1(2\cdot 1 + 3\cdot (-2)+4\cdot 1)=0\\
\\
b_4= -1(2\cdot 0+3\cdot 1 + 4\cdot (-2)+5\cdot 1)=0\\
\\
b_5= -1(2\cdot 0+3\cdot 0+4\cdot (1)+5\cdot (-2)+6\cdot 1)=0\\
\\
\quad \vdots \\
\\
b_s= -1(2\cdot 0 + 3\cdot 0+\cdots (s-2)\cdot 0+(s-1)\cdot 1+s\cdot (-2)+(s+1)\cdot 1)=0\textrm{      }s\geq 3\)



Hence, \(g(x) = 1 - 2x +x^2\) is the multiplicative inverse of \(f(x)\). 



If we compare Theorems 16.5.2 and 16.5.3, we note that while the only elements in \(F[x]\) that are units are the nonzero constants of <m>F</m>,
the units in \(F[[x]]\) are every single expression in <m>x</m> where \(a_0\neq 0\). So certainly \(F[[x]]\) contains a wider variety of units
than \(F[x]\). Yet \(F[[x]]\) is not a field, since \(x\in  F[[x]]\) is not a unit by Theorem 16.5.3. So concerning the algebraic structure of \(F[[x]]\),
we know that it is an integral domain that contains \(F[x]\). If we allow our power series to take on negative exponents$---$that is, consider expressions
of the form



$\quad \quad $\(f(x) =\sum_{i=-\infty }^{\infty } a_i x^i\)



where all but a finite number of terms with a negative index equal zero.  These expressions are called extended power series. . The set
of all such expressions is a field, call it <m>E</m>. This set does contain, for example, the inverse of <m>x</m> namely \(x^{-1}\). It can
be shown that each nonzero element of <m>E</m> is a unit.
