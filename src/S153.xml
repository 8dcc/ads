At the risk of boggling the reader's mind, we will now examine groups whose elements are functions. Recall that a permutation on a set <m>A</m>
is a bijection from <m>A</m> into <m>A</m>. Suppose that \(A = \{1, 2, 3\}\). There are \(3! = 6\) different permutations on <m>A</m>. We
will call the set of all 6 permutations \(S_3\).  They are listed in Table 15.3.1. The matrix form for describing a function on a finite set is
to list the domain across the top row and the image of each element directly below it. For example \(r_1(1) = 2\).



  \(\begin{array}{cc}
 i =\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\
 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\
\end{array}
\right)  &amp; f_1=\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\
 1 &amp; 3 &amp; 2 \\
\end{array}
\right) \\
 r_1=\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\
 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 1 \\
\end{array}
\right) &amp; f_2=\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\
 3 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 \\
\end{array}
\right) \\
 r_2=\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\
 3 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 \\
\end{array}
\right) &amp; f_3=\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\
 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 3 \\
\end{array}
\right) \\
\end{array}\)             


\caption{\pmb{ Table 15.3.1\\
Elements of \(S_3\)}} 



The operation that will give \(\left\{i,r_1,r_2,f_1,f_2,f_3\right\}\) a group structure is function composition. Consider the <q>product</q> \(r_1\circ
f_3\):



$\quad \quad $\(r_1\circ f_3(1) =r_1\left(f_3(1)\right)= r_1(2)=3 \\
\\
r_1\circ f_3(2)=r_1\left(f_3(2)\right)= r_1(1)= 2\\
\\
r_1\circ f_3(3)=r_1\left(f_3(3)\right)= r_1(3)= 1\)



The images of 1, 2, and 3 under \(r_1\circ f_3\) and \(f_2\)are identical. Thus, by the definition of equality for functions, we can say \(r_1\circ
f_3=f_2\) . The complete table for the operation of function composition is given in Table 15.3.2. We don't even need the table to verify that we
have a group:

<ol label="a">
<li><p>  Function composition is always associative (see Chapter 7).</p></li>
<li><p>  The identity for the group is <m>i</m>. If <m>g</m> is any one of the permutations on <m>A</m> and  \(x\in A\),



$\quad \quad $\(g\circ i(x) = g(i(x)) = g(x)\)



and



$\quad \quad $\(i\circ g(x) = i(g(x)) = g(x)\).



Therefore   \(g\circ i = i\circ g=g\).</p></li>
<li><p> A permutation, by definition, is a bijection.  In Chapter 7 we proved that this implies that it must have an inverse and the inverse itself
is a bijection and hence a permutation.    Hence all elements of \(S_3\) have an inverse in \(S_3\). If a permutation is displayed in matrix
form, its inverse can be obtained by exchanging the two rows and rearranging the columns so that the top row is in order. The first step is actually
sufficient to obtain the inverse, but the sorting of the top row makes it easier to recognize the inverse.



<example xml:id="ex-15.3.1."><title>15.3.1.</title><p></p></example> Lets consider a typical permutation on \(\{1,2,3,4,5\}\), 



$\quad \quad $\(f= \left(
\begin{array}{ccccc}
 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 5 \\
 5 &amp; 3 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 4 \\
\end{array}
\right)\).



\(f^{-1}=\text \left(
\begin{array}{ccccc}
 5 &amp; 3 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 4 \\
 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 5 \\
\end{array}
\right)= \left(
\begin{array}{ccccc}
 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 5 \\
 4 &amp; 3 &amp; 2 &amp; 5 &amp; 1 \\
\end{array}
\right)\)



Note from Table 15.3.2 that this group is non-abelian. Remember, non-abelian is the negation of abelian. The existence of two elements that don't
commute is sufficient to make a group non-abelian. In this group, \(r_1\) and \(f_3\) is one such pair: \(r_1\circ f_3= f_2\)  while   \(f_3\circ
r_1= f_1\), so \(r_1\circ f_3\neq f_3\circ r_1\).   Caution:  Don{'}t take this to mean that every pair of elements has to have this property.
 There are several pairs of elements in \(S_3\) that do.  commute.   In fact, the identity, <m>i</m>, must commute with everything.
 Also every element must commute with its inverse.

<definition xml:id="def-Symmetric Group."><title>Symmetric Group.</title><index><main>Symmetric Group.</main></index><notation><usage></usage><description></description></notation><statement><p></p></statement></definition>

 Let A be a nonempty set. The set of all permutations on A with the operation of function composition is called
the symmetric group on A, denoted \(S_A\). 



Our main interest will be in the case where <m>A</m> is finite. The size of <m>A</m> is more significant than the elements, and we will denote
by \(S_k\) the symmetric group on any set of cardinality k, . \(k\geq 1\).

<example xml:id="ex-15.3.2."><title>15.3.2.</title><p></p></example> Our opening example, \(S_3\), is the smallest non-abelian group. For that reason, all of its proper subgroups are abelian:
in fact, they are all cyclic. Figure 15.3.1 shows the Hasse diagram for the subgroups of \(S_3\).

<example xml:id="ex-15.3.3."><title>15.3.3.</title><p></p></example> The only abelian symmetric groups are \(S_1\) and \(S_2\) , with 1 and 2 elements, respectively. The elements of \(S_2\) are

\(i = \left(

 1 &amp; 2 \\
\end{array}
\right)\)    and  \(\alpha = \left(
\begin{array}{cc}
 1 &amp; 2 \\
 2 &amp; 1 \\
\end{array}

\(S_2\) is isomorphic to \(\mathbb{Z}_2\).

<theorem xml:id="theorem-15.3.1."><title>15.3.1.</title><index><main>15.3.1.</main></index><statement></statement><proof></proof></theorem>  For \(k \geq  1\), \(\left\left| S_k\right\right| =k!\)  and for \(k \geq  3\), \(S_k\) is non-abelian.



Proof: The first part of the theorem follows from the extended rule of products (see Chapter 2). We leave the details of proof of the second part
to the reader after the following hint.   Consider <m>f</m>  in \(S_k\) where \(f(1) = 2\), \(f(2) = 3\), \(f(3) = 1\), and \(f(j) = j\) for
\(3 < j \leq  n\).  Now define <m>g</m> in a similar manner so that when you compare \(f(g(1))\) and \(g(f(1))\) you get different results.
$\blacksquare $



<subsubsection xml:id="sss-Cycle Notation"><title>Cycle Notation</title><index><main>Cycle Notation</main></index>



A second way of describing a permutation is by means of cycles, which we will introduce first with an example. Consider  \(f\in S_8\) :



$\quad \quad $\(f=\left(
\begin{array}{cccccccc}
 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 &amp; 7 &amp; 8 \\
 8 &amp; 2 &amp; 7 &amp; 6 &amp; 5 &amp; 4 &amp; 1 &amp; 3 \\
\end{array}
\right)\)



Consider the images of 1 when <m>f</m> is applied repeatedly. The images \(f(1)\), \(f(f(1))\), \(f(f(f(1)))\), \(\ldots\) are 8, 3, 7, 1, 8,
3, 7, ... . If \(j\geq 1\),  In Figure 15.3.2(a), this situation is represented by the component of the graph that consists of 1, 8, 3, and 7 and
shows that the values that you get by repeatedly applying f .  cycle through those values.   This is why we refer to this part of \textit{
f} as a cycle of length 4. .  Of course starting at 8, 3, or 7 also produces the same cycle with only the starting valued changing. 


\begin{center}\(\)
\end{center}


\caption{\pmb{ Figure 15.3.2\\
Representations of cycles of length 4.}}



Figure 15.3.2(a) illustrates how the cycle can be represented in a visual manner, but it is a bit awkward to write.. Part (b) of the figure presents
a more universally recognized way to write a cycle.  In (b), a cycle is represented by a list where the image of any number in the list is its
successor.  In addition, the last number in the list has as its image the first number. 



The other elements of the domain of <m>f</m>, are never reached if you start in the cycle \((1,8,3,7)\), and so looking at image of these other
numbers will produce numbers that are disjoint from the set \(\{1,8,3,7\}\).   The other disjoint.  cycles.  of <m>f</m>  are
 (2), (4, 6), and (5).  We can express <m>f</m> as a product of disjoint cycles. :



$\quad \quad $\(f= (1, 8, 3, 7)(2)(4, 6)(5)\)



or



$\quad \quad $\(f= (1,8,3,7)(4,6)\)



where the absence of 2 and 5 implies that \(f(2) = 2\) and \(f(5) = 5\).



\pmb{ Disjoint Cycles.} We say that two cycles are disjoint if no number appears in both cycles, as is the case in our expressions for /. 
above. Disjoint cycles can be written in any order. Thus, we could also say that



$\quad \quad $\(f= (4,6)(1,8,3,7)\).



\pmb{ Composing Permutations.} We will now consider the composition of permutations written in cyclic form, again by an example. Suppose that \(f
= (1,8, 3, 7)(4, 6)\) and \(g = (1, 5, 6)(8, 3, 7, 4)\) are elements of \(S_8\). To calculate \(f\circ g\), we start with simple concatenation:



 \(f \circ g = (1,8, 3, 7)(4, 6)(1,5,6)(8, 3, 7,4)\).                                         (P)



Although this is a valid expression for \(f \circ g\), our goal is to express the composition as a product of disjoint cycles as <m>f</m> and
<m>g</m> were individually written. We will start by determining the cycle that contains 1. \textit{ When combining any number of cycles, they
are always read from right to left.} The first cycle  in (P) does not contain 1; thus we move on to the second. The image of 1 under that cycle
is 5. Now we move on to the next cycle, looking for 5, which doesn't appear. The fourth cycle does not contain a 5 either; so \(f\circ g(1) = 5\).
At this point, we would have written



\(f \circ g = (1,5\)



on paper. We repeat the steps to determine \(f\circ g(5)\). This time the second cycle of (P) moves 5 to 6 and then the third cycle moves 6 to 4.
Therefore, \(f\circ g(5) = 4\). We continue until the cycle (1, 5, 4, 3) is completed by determining that \(f\circ g(3) = 1\). The process is  then
repeated starting with any number that does not appear in the cycle(s) that have already obtained. The final result for our example is



\(f \circ g = (1, 5, 4, 3)(6, 8, 7)\).



Since \(f(2) = 2\) and \(g(2) = 2\), \(f\circ g(2) = 2\) and we need not include the one-cycle (2).

Video:  For a video that illustrates this process, go to http://faculty.uml.edu/klevasseur/ads2/videos/cyclecomposition/.

<example xml:id="ex-15.3.4."><title>15.3.4.</title><p></p></example><ol label="a">
<li><p> \((1, 2, 3, 4)(1, 2, 3, 4) = (1, 3)(2, 4)\).

(b) \((1, 4)(1, 3)(1, 2) = (1, 2, 3, 4)\).

Note that the cyclic notation does not indicate the set which is being permuted. The examples above could be in \(S_5\), where the image of 5 is
5. This ambiguity is usually overcome by making the context clear at the start of a discussion.

<definition xml:id="def-Transposition."><title>Transposition.</title><index><main>Transposition.</main></index><notation><usage></usage><description></description></notation><statement><p></p></statement></definition>

 A transposition is a cycle of length 2,

<example xml:id="ex-15.3.5."><title>15.3.5.</title><p></p></example>  \(f= (1, 4)\) and \(g=(4,5)\)\(\textrm{ \textit{}}\)are transpositions in \(S_5\).  \(f\circ g = (1,4, 5)\) and \(g \circ
f = (1, 5, 4)\) are not transpositions; thus, the set of transpositions is not closed under composition. Since \(f^2=f\circ f\) and \(g^2=g\circ
g\) are both equal to the identity permutation,  <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are their own inverses. In fact, every transposition is its own inverse.

<theorem xml:id="theorem-15.3.2."><title>15.3.2.</title><index><main>15.3.2.</main></index><statement></statement><proof></proof></theorem> Every cycle of length greater than 2 can be expressed as a product of transpositions.



Instead of a formal proof, we will indicate how the product of transpositions can be obtained. The key fact needed is that if \(\left(a_1, a_2, a_3,
\ldots , a_k\right)\) is a cycle of length <m>k</m>, it is equal to the following product of \(k-1\) cycles.



\(\left(a_1, a_k\right) \cdots \left(a_1,a_3\right)\left(a_1,a_2\right)\)



Example 11.3.4 (b) illustrates this fact. Of course, a product of cycles can be written as a product of transpositions just as easily by applying
the rule above to each cycle. For example,



\((1, 3, 5, 7)(2, 4, 6) = (1, 7)(1, 5)(1, 3)(2, 6)(2, 4)\).



Unlike the situation with disjoint cycles, we are not free to change the order of these transpositions.



The proofs of the following two theorems appear in many abstract algebra texts.

<theorem xml:id="theorem-15.3.3."><title>15.3.3.</title><index><main>15.3.3.</main></index><statement></statement><proof></proof></theorem> Every permutation on a finite set can be expressed as the product of an even number of transpositions or an odd number of
transpositions, but not both.



Theorem 15.3.3 suggests that \(S_n\) can be partitioned into its <q>even</q> and <q>odd</q> elements.

<example xml:id="ex-15.3.6."><title>15.3.6.</title><p></p></example> The even permutations of \(S_3\) are i . , \(r_1=\) and \(r_2=\) .  They form a subgroup, \(\left\{i,r_1,r_2\right\}
\textrm{ of} S_3\). 



In general:

<theorem xml:id="theorem-15.3.4. "><title>15.3.4. </title><index><main>15.3.4. </main></index><statement></statement><proof></proof></theorem> Let \(n \geq 2\). The set of even permutations in \(S_n\) is a proper subgroup of \(S_n\) called the alternating group on
\(\{1, 2, . . . n\}\), denoted \(A_n\). The order of \(A_n\) is \(\frac{n!}{2}\).

Proof: In this proof, the letters \(s\) and <m>t</m> stand for transpositions and <m>p</m>, <m>q</m> are even.  nonnegative integers.

If  \(f, g \in A_n\),  we can write the two permutations as products of even numbers of transpositions:

\(f\circ g=s_1s_2\cdots  s_pt_1t_2\cdots  t_q\)

Since \(p+q\) is even, \(f\circ g \in A_n\).   Since \(A_n\) is closed With respect to function composition, we have proven that \(A_n\) is a subgroup
of \(S_n\). by Theorem 11.5.2.  To prove the final assertion, let \(B_n\) be the set of odd permutations and let \(\tau  = (1,2)\). Define \(\theta
: A_n \to  B_n\) by \(\theta (f) = f\circ \tau\). Suppose that \(\theta (f) = \theta (g)\). Then f$\circ \tau $ = g$\circ \tau $ and by the cancellation
law,  f = g. Hence, $\theta $ is an injection.  Next we show that $\theta $ is also a surjection.  If \(h \in  B_n\), <m>h</m> is the image
of an element of \(A_n\).  Specifically, <m>h</m> is the image of \(h\circ \tau\).

\(\textrm{           }\theta (h\circ \tau ) = (h\circ \tau )\circ \tau \textrm{      }\textrm{ Why}?\quad = h\circ (\tau \circ \tau )\textrm{      }\textrm{ Why}?\textrm{ 
            }= h\circ i\textrm{              }\textrm{ Why}?\textrm{         }= h\textrm{             }\textrm{ Why}?\)

Since \(\theta\) is a bijection,   \(\left\left| A_n\right\right| =\left\left| B_n\right\right| =\frac{n!}{2}\).   $\blacksquare $

<example xml:id="ex-15.3.8."><title>15.3.8.</title><p></p></example> Consider the sliding-tile puzzles pictured in Figure 15.3.3. Each numbered square is a tile and the dark square is a gap.
Any tile that is adjacent to the gap can slide into the gap. In most versions of this puzzle, the tiles are locked into a frame so that they can
be moved only in the manner described above. The object of the puzzle is to arrange the tiles as they appear in Configuration a.  Configurations
b and c are typical starting points. We propose to show why the puzzle can be solved starting with b, but not with c.


\begin{center}\(\)
\end{center}


\caption{\pmb{ Figure 15.3.3\\
Configurations of the tile puzzle.}}

We will associate any configuration of the puzzle with an element of \(S_{16}\). Imagine that a tile numbered 16 fills in the gap. If <m>f</m>
is any configuration of the puzzle, <m>i</m> is Configuration a, and for \(1 \leq  k \leq  16\),

      \(f(k) = \textrm{ the} \textrm{ number} \textrm{ that} \textrm{ appears} \textrm{ in} \textrm{ the} \textrm{ position} \textrm{ of} k \textrm{ of} i\).

If we call Configurations b and c by the names \(f_1\) and \(f_2\) respectively,

\(f_1 = (1, 5, 3, 7)(2, 6, 4, 8)(9, 10)(11, 14, 13, 12)(15)(16)\)

and

\(f_2 = (1, 5, 3, 7, 15)(2, 6, 4, 8)(9, 10)(11, 14, 13, 12)(16)\).

How can we interpret the movement of one tile as a permutation? Consider what happens when the 12 tile of <m>i</m> slides into the gap. The result
is a configuration that we would interpret as \((12,16)\), a single transposition. Now if we slide the 8 tile into the 12 position, the result is
or \((8, 16, 12)\). Hence, by <q>exchanging</q> the tiles 8 and 16, we have obtained \((8, 16) (12, 16) = (8, 16, 12)\).


\begin{center}\(\)
\end{center}


\caption{\pmb{ Figure 15.3.4\\
The configuration }\((8, 16, 12)\)\pmb{ .}}

Every time you slide a tile into the gap, the new permutation is a transposition composed with the old permutation. Now observe that to start with
<m>i</m> and terminate after a finite number of moves with the gap in its original position, you must make an even number of moves. Thus, any
permutation that leaves 16 fixed, such as \(f_1\) or \(f_2\),  cannot be solved if it is odd.  Note that \(f_2\) is an odd permutation; thus,
Puzzle c can't be solved. The proof that all even permutations, such as  \(f_1\), can be solved is left to the interested reader to pursue.



\pmb{ Realizations of Groups.}  By now we{'}ve seen several instances a group can appear through an isomorphic copy of itself in various settings.
  The simplest such example is the cyclic group of order 2.   When this group is mentioned, we might naturally think of the group \(\left[\mathbb{Z}_2,+_2\right]\),
but the groups \([\{-1,1\},\cdot ]\)  and \(\left[S_2,\circ \right]\) are isomorphic to it.  None of these groups are necessarily more natural
or important than the others.  Which one you use depends on the situation you are in and all are referred to as realizations.  of the cyclic
group of order 2.   The next family of groups we will study has two natural realizations, first as permutations and second as geometric symmetries.




<example xml:id="ex-15.3.9. Dihedral Groups."><title>15.3.9. Dihedral Groups.</title><p></p></example> The dihedral groups can realized in several ways and we will concentrate on two of them.  They can be visualized
as symmetries of a regular polygon $---$ this is probably the easiest way to understand the groups.  In order to represent the groups on a computer,
it is convenient to represent the groups as  subgroups of the symmetric groups.   If \(k\geq  3\), the dihedral group, \(D_k\) , is a subgroup
of \(S_k\).   It is the subgroup of \(S_k\) generated by the k-. 



\pmb{ Realization as symmetries of regular polygons.}



We can describe \(D_n\) in terms of symmetries of a regular <m>n</m>-gon (\(n = 3\): equilateral triangle, \(n = 4\): square, \(n = 5\): a regular
pentagon, $\ldots $).  Here we will only concentrate on the case of \(D_4\). If a square is fixed in space, there are several motions of the square
that will, at the end of the motion, not change the apparent position of the square. The actual changes in position can be seen if the corners of
the square are labeled. In Figure 15.3.5, the initial labeling scheme is shown, along with the four axes of symmetry of the square.

\begin{doublespace}
\noindent\(\)
\end{doublespace}


\caption{\pmb{ Figure 15.3.5\\
Axes of symmetry of the square.}}



It might be worthwhile making a square like this with a sheet of paper. Be careful to label the back so that the numbers match up. Two motions of
the square will be considered equivalent if the square is in the same position after performing either motion. There are eight distinct motions.
The first four are \(0{}^{\circ}\), \(90{}^{\circ}\), \(180{}^{\circ}\), and \(270{}^{\circ}\) clockwise rotations of the square, and the other four
are the 180${}^{\circ}$ flips along the axes \(l_1\), \(l_2\), \(l_3\), and \(l_4\). We \\
will call the rotations \(i, r_1\), \(r_2\), and \(r_3\), respectively, and the flips \(f_1\), \(f_2\), \(f_3\), and \(f_4\), respectively. Figure
15.3.6 illustrates \(r_1\) and \(f_1\).  For future reference we also include the permutations to which they will correspond.


\begin{center}\(\)
\end{center}


\caption{\pmb{ Figure 15.3.6\\
Two elements of }\(D_4\)}



What is the operation on this set of symmetries?   We will call the operation <q>followed by</q> and use the symbol \(*\)  to represent it.
 The operation will be combine motions,  apply motions from right to left, as with functions.  We will illustrate how \(*\) is computed by
finding  \(r_1*f_1\).    Starting with the initial configuration, if you perform the \(f_1 \unicode{0008}\)motion, and then immediately perform
\(r_1\) on the result, we get the same configuration as if we just performed \(f_4\), which is to flip the square along the line \(l_4\).   Therefore,
  \(r_1*f_1 = f_4\).



\pmb{ Realization as permutations.}



We can also realize the dihedral groups as permutations.  For any symmetric motion of the square we can associate with it a permutation.   In
the case of \(D_4\), the images of each of the numbers 1 through 4 are the positions on the square that each of the corners 1 through 4 are moved
to.  For example, since corner 4 moves to position 1 when you perform \(r_1\),  the corresponding function will map 4 to 1.   In addition,
1 gets mapped to 2, 2 to 3 and 3 to 4.  Therefore, \(r_1\) is the cycle \((1,2,3,4)\) .   The flip \(f_1\)transposed two pairs of corners and
corresponds to \((1,4)(2,3)\).  If we want to combine these two permutations, using the same names as with motions, we get



\(r_1\circ f_1= (1,2,3,4)\circ (1,4)(2,3)=(1)(2,4)(3) = (2,4)\).   



Notice that this permutation is corresponds withe flip \(f_4\).



Although \(D_4\) isn{'}t cyclic (since it isn{'}t abelian), it can be generated from the two elements \(r_1\) and \(f_1\):



\(D_4= \left\langle r_1,f_1\right\rangle = \left\{i,r_1,r_1{}^2,r_1{}^3,f_1,r_1\circ f_1,r_1{}^2\circ f_1,r_1{}^3\circ f_1\right\}\) 



It is quite easy to describe any of the dihedral groups in a similar fashion.   Let



\(r= (1,2, \ldots , n)\),    an n-. cycle,   and



\(f= (1,n)(2,n-1)\ldots\)



Then \(D_n= \langle r,f\rangle  = \left\{i,r,r^2,\ldots  , r^{n-1},f,r\circ f_ ,r^2\circ f,\ldots , r^{n-1}\circ f\right\}\)



\pmb{ An application of }\(D_4\)\pmb{ .}  One application of \(D_4\) is in the design of a letter-facing machine.  Imagine letters entering a
conveyor belt to be postmarked. They are placed on the conveyor belt at random so that two sides are parallel to the belt. Suppose that a postmarker
can recognize a stamp in the top right corner of the envelope, on the side facing up. In Figure 15.3.7, a sequence of machines is shown that will
recognize a stamp on any letter, no matter what position in which the letter starts. The letter P stands for a postmarker. The letters R and F stand
for rotating and flipping machines that perform the motions of \(r_1\) and \(f_1\) .

A letter facer}}



The arrows pointing up indicate that if a letter is postmarked, it is taken off the conveyor belt for delivery. If a letter reaches the end, it must
not have a stamp. Letter-facing machines like this have been designed (see Gallian{'}s paper). One economic consideration is that R-machines tend
to cost more than F-machines. R-machines also tend to damage more letters. Taking these facts into consideration, the reader is invited to design
a better letter-facing machine. Assume that R-machines cost $\$$800 and F-machines cost $\$$500. Be sure that all corners of incoming
letters will be examined as they go down the conveyor belt.
