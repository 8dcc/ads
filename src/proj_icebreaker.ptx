<p>
  For this activity, you will analyze graphs from real life. 
</p>
<ol>
  <li><p>
  Pick a communication method you use often (e.g. phone, text, chat, email, social messaging). 
</p>
</li>
  <li><p>
  Look at the ten most recent conversations you have had using that method. Draw a graph with a vertex for each of the people involved in those conversations, <em>except yourself</em>. Label the vertices so you know which one is which (you may use nicknames or anonymize as a, b, etc.). 
</p>
</li>
  <li><p>
  Draw an edge between any two people that communicate directly. For example, if you recently called your sister, your mother, and a pizza place, you should draw an edge between your sister and your mother (because they talk to each other) but not your sister and the pizza place (unless she also orders pizza from there). 
</p>
</li>
  <li><p>
  Try to make it as clear as possible, redrawing if necessary. Print your name at the top of paper. You'll turn this graph in with answers to the next three steps at the end of the class. 
</p>
</li>
  <li><p>
  Which vertex has the highest degree, and what does that tell you about the person? 
</p>
</li>
  <li><p>
  Which vertex has the lowest degree, and what does that tell you about the person? 
</p>
</li>
  <li><p>
  What is the longest path between two people in this graph, and what does that tell you about those two people? 
</p>
</li>
  <li><p>
  Redraw your clearest drawing from step 4,<!-- \textbf --><term>with the labels removed.</term> Write your name at the top of the paper. Pass it to a neighbor in your breakout group. 
</p>
</li>
  <li><p>
  Write your name below your neighbor's name on the graph you just got. Look at the graph your group member gave you. What does it have in common with your graph? How is it different? 
</p>
</li>
  <li><p>
  Make a conjecture about the people represented in your neighbor's graph and explain why you think it might be true. 
</p>
</li>
  <li><p>
  At the end of the class, turn in two things. 
</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>
  The graph you got from your neighbor, with their name above your name. 
</p>
</li>
  <li><p>
  The original graph you created with labels, answers to three questions, and your name at the top. 
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
