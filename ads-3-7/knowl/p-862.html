<p>In traditional logic, a declarative statement with a definite truth value is considered a proposition. Although our ultimate aim is to discuss mathematical logic, we won't separate ourselves completely from the traditional setting. This is natural because the basic assumptions, or postulates, of mathematical logic are modeled after the logic we use in everyday life. Since compound sentences are frequently used in everyday speech, we expect that logical propositions contain connectives like the word “and.” The statement “Europa supports life or Mars supports life” is a proposition and, hence, must have a definite truth value. Whatever that truth value is, it should be the same as the truth value of “Mars supports life or Europa supports life.”</p>
