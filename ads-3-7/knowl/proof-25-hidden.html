<p>This is a proof by Induction on the Number of Vertices in the Graph.</p>
<p>Basis: Clearly, a graph with one vertex has a chromatic number of 1.</p>
<p>Induction: Assume that all planar graphs with \(n - 1\) vertices have a chromatic number of 5 or less. Let \(G\) be a planar graph. By <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/theorem-degree-5.html" title="Theorem 9.6.12: A Vertex of Degree Five">Theorem 9.6.12</a>, there exists a vertex \(v\) with \(\deg  v \leq 5\text{.}\) Let \(G - v\) be the planar graph obtained by deleting \(v\) and all edges that connect \(v\) to other vertices in \(G\text{.}\) By the induction hypothesis, \(G - v\) has a 5-coloring. Assume that the colors used are red, white, blue, green, and yellow.</p>
<p>If \(\deg  v &lt; 5\text{,}\) then we can produce a 5-coloring of \(G\) by selecting a color that is not used in coloring the vertices that are connected to \(v\) with an edge in \(G\text{.}\)</p>
<p>If \(\deg  v = 5\text{,}\) then we can use the same approach if the five vertices that are adjacent to \(v\) are not all colored differently. We are now left with the possibility that \(v_1\text{,}\) \(v_2\text{,}\) \(v_3\text{,}\) \(v_4\text{,}\) and \(v_5\) are all connected to \(v\) by an edge and they are all colored differently. Assume that they are colored red, white blue, yellow, and green, respectively, as in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-five-coloring-proof.html" title="Figure 9.6.17">Figure 9.6.17</a>.</p>

<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">9.6.17<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span></figcaption></figure><p>Starting at \(v_1\) in \(G-v\text{,}\) suppose we try to construct a path \(v_3\) that passes through only red and blue vertices.  This can either be accomplished or it can't be accomplished. If it can't be done, consider all paths that start at \(v_1\text{,}\) and go through only red and blue vertices. If we exchange the colors of the vertices in these paths, including \(v_1\) we still have a 5-coloring of \(G - v\text{.}\) Since \(v_1\) is now blue, we can color the central vertex, \(v\text{,}\) red.</p>
<p>Finally, suppose that \(v_1\) is connected to \(v_3\) using only red and blue vertices. Then a path from \(v_{1 }\) to \(v_3\) by using red and blue vertices followed by the edges \(\left(v_3,v\right)\) and \(\left(v,v_1\right)\) completes a circuit that either encloses \(v_2\) or encloses \(v_4\) and \(v_5\text{.}\) Therefore, no path from \(v_2\) to \(v_4\) exists using only white and yellow vertices. We can then repeat the same process as in the previous paragraph with \(v_2\) and \(v_4\text{,}\) which will allow us to color v white.</p></article></body>
