<p>(a) Suppose each single character stored in a computer uses eight bits. Then each character is represented by a different sequence of eight 0's and 1's called a bit pattern. How many different bit patterns are there? (That is, how many different characters could be represented?)</p>
<p>(b) How many bit patterns are palindromes (the same backwards as forwards)?</p>
<p>(c) How many different bit patterns have an even number of 1's?</p>
