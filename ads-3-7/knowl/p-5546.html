<p>Every time you slide a tile into the gap, the new permutation is a transposition composed with the old permutation. Now observe that to start with initial configuration and terminate after a finite number of moves with the gap in its original position, you must make an even number of moves. Thus, configuration corresponding any permutation that leaves 16 fixed  cannot be solved if the permutation is odd.  Note that \(f_2\) is an odd permutation; thus, Puzzle (c) can't be solved. The proof that all even permutations, such as  \(f_1\text{,}\) can be solved is left to the interested reader to pursue.</p>
