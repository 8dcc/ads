<p>When solving systems of equations with mod 2 arithmetic, the elementary row operations are still fundamental.  However, since there is only one nonzero element, 1, you never need to multiply a row by a nonzero constant.   One other big difference is that the number of possible solutions is always finite.  If you have \(m\) linear equations in \(n\) unknowns, each unknown can only take on one of two values, 0 or 1.   Therefore there are only \(2^n\) possible \(n\)-tuples to from which to draw a solution set.   Assuming \(m \leq n\text{,}\) you typically (but not always) will have \(m\) basic variables after row-reduction and \(n-m\) free variable.  If this is the case, and any solution exists, there will be \(2^{n-m}\) different solutions.</p>
