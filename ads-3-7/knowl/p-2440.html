<p>We would now like to define the concepts of identity and inverse for functions under composition. The motivation and descriptions of the definitions of these terms come from the definitions of the terms in the set of real numbers and for matrices. For real numbers, the numbers 0 and 1 play the unique role that \(x + 0 = 0 + x = x\) and \(x \cdot 1 = 1 \cdot  x = x\) for any real number \(x\text{.}\)  0 and 1 are the identity elements for the reals under the operations of addition and multiplication, respectively. Similarly, the \(n \times  n\) zero matrix 0 and the \(n \times
n\) identity matrix \(I\) are such that for any \(n \times  n\) matrix \(A\text{,}\) \(A + 0 = 0 + A=A\) and \(A I = I A = I\text{.}\) Hence, an elegant way of defining the identity function under the operation of composition would be to imitate the above well-known facts.</p>
