<li><p>Write the associated homogeneous relation and find its general solution (Steps (a) through (c) of <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/algorithm-linear-homogeneous-recurrence-relations.html" title="Algorithm 8.3.12: Algorithm for Solving Homogeneous Finite Order Linear Relations">Algorithm 8.3.12</a>). Call this the homogeneous solution, \(S^{(h)}(k)\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Start to obtain what is called a particular solution, \(S^{(p)}(k)\) of the recurrence relation by taking an educated guess at the form of a particular solution. For a large class of right-hand sides, this is not really a guess, since the particular solution is often the same type of function as \(f(k)\) (see <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/tab-particular-sols.html" title="Table 8.3.17: Particular solutions for given right-hand sides">Table 8.3.17</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Substitute your guess from Step 2 into the recurrence relation. If you made a good guess, you should be able to determine the unknown coefficients of your guess. If you made a wrong guess, it should be apparent from the result of this substitution, so go back to Step 2.</p></li>
<li><p>The general solution of the recurrence relation is the sum of the homogeneous and particular solutions. If no conditions are given, then you are finished. If \(n\) initial conditions are given, they will translate to \(n\) linear equations in \(n\) unknowns and solve the system to get a complete solution.</p></li>
