<p>One of the most significant features of a finite-state machine is that it retains no information about its past states that can be accessed by the machine itself. For example, after we input a tape encoded with the symbols 01101010 into the parity checker, the current state will be even, but we have no indication within the machine whether or not it has always been in even state. Note how the output tape is not considered part of the machine's memory. In this case, the output tape does contain a “history” of the parity checker's past states. We  assume that the finite-state machine has no way of recovering the output sequence for later use.</p>
