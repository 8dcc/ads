<li><p>To read this truth table, you must realize that any one line represents a case: one possible set of values for \(p\) and \(q\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>The numbers 0 and 1 are used to denote false and true, respectively. This is consistent with the way that many programming languages treat logical, or Boolean, variables since a single bit, 0 or 1, can represent a truth value.</p></li>
<li><p>For each case, the symbol under \(p\) represents the truth value of \(p\text{.}\) The same is true for \(q\text{.}\) The symbol under \(p \land q\) represents its truth value for that case. For example, the second row of the truth table represents the case in which \(p\) is false, \(q\) is true, and the resulting truth value for \(p \land q\) is false. As in everyday speech, \(p \land q\) is true only when both propositions are true.</p></li>
<li><p>Just as the letters \(x\text{,}\) \(y\) and \(z\) are frequently used in algebra to represent numeric variables, \(p\text{,}\) \(q\) and \(r\) seem to be the most commonly used symbols for logical variables. When we say that \(p\) is a logical variable, we mean that any proposition can take the place of \(p\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>One final comment: The order in which we list the cases in a truth table is standardized in this book. If the truth table involves two simple propositions, the numbers under the simple propositions can be interpreted as the two-digit binary integers in increasing order, 00, 01, 10, and 11, for 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively.</p></li>
