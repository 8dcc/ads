<p>No, such a line does not exist.  The dominoes with two different numbers correspond with edges in a \(K_6\text{.}\) Those with two equal numbers could be held back and inserted into the line created with the other dominoes if such a line of dominoes exists   For example, if \((1,2),(2,5)\) were part of the line, \((2,2)\) could be inserted between them. The line we want exists if there would exists an Eulerian path in a \(K_6\text{.}\)  Since all six vertices of a \(K_6\) have odd degree no such path exists.</p>
