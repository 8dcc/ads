<p>The expression \(x_1 \cdot  x_2\) represents the situation in which a series of two switches appears in sequence as in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-and-switch.html" title="Figure 13.7.4">Figure 13.7.4</a>. In order for current to flow through the circuit, both switches must be ON; that is, they must both have the value 1.  Similarly, a pair of parallel switches, as in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-or-switch.html" title="Figure 13.7.5">Figure 13.7.5</a>, is described algebraically by \(x_1 + x_2\text{.}\) Here, current flows through this part of the circuit as long as at least on of the switches is ON.</p>
