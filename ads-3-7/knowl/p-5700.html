<p>We will assume that our information is being sent along a <dfn class="terminology">binary symmetric channel</dfn>. By this, we mean that any single bit that is transmitted will be received improperly with a certain fixed probability, \(p\text{,}\) independent of the bit value.   The magnitude of \(p\) is usually quite small. To illustrate the process, we will assume that \(p = 0.001\text{,}\) which, in the real world, would be considered somewhat large. Since \(1 - p = 0.999\text{,}\) we can expect \(99.9\%\) of all bits to be properly received.</p>
