<p>In the previous sections we examined the solutions of a few equations over different rings and fields. To solve the equation \(x^2- 2 = 0\) over the field of the real numbers means to find all solutions of this equation that are in this particular field \(\mathbb{R}\text{.}\) This statement can be replaced as follows: Determine all \(a \in  \mathbb{R}\) such that the polynomial \(f(x) = x^2 - 2\) is equal to zero when evaluated at \(x=a\text{.}\) In this section, we will concentrate on  the theory of polynomials. We will develop concepts using the general setting of polynomials over rings since results proven over rings are true for fields (and integral domains). The reader should keep in mind that in most cases we are just formalizing concepts that he or she learned in high school algebra over the field of reals.</p>
