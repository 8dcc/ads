<p>This is called an iterative computation of the Fibonacci sequence. Here we start with the basis and work our way forward to a less simple number, such as 5. Try to compute \(F_5\) using the recursive definition for \(F\) as we did for \(F_4\text{.}\) It will take much more time than it would have taken to do the computations above. Iterative computations usually tend to be faster than computations that apply recursion. Therefore, one useful skill is being able to convert a recursive formula into a nonrecursive formula, such as one that requires only iteration or a faster method, if possible.</p>
