<body><article class="example example-like"><p>Consider the polynomial \(f(x) = x^2-2\) taken as being in \(\mathbb{Q}\)[x]. From high school algebra we know that \(f(x)\) has two zeros (or roots), namely \(\pm \sqrt{2}\text{,}\) and \(x^2 - 2\) can be factored  as \(\left(x - \sqrt{2}\right) \left(x + \sqrt{2}\right)\text{.}\) However, we are working in \(\mathbb{Q}[x]\text{,}\) these two factors are not in the set of polynomials over the rational numbers, \(\mathbb{Q}\)  since \(\sqrt{2} \notin \mathbb{Q}\) .   Therefore, \(x^2 - 2\) does not have a zero in \(\mathbb{Q}\) since it cannot be factored over \(\mathbb{Q}\text{.}\) When this happens, we say that the polynomial is irreducible over \(\mathbb{Q}\text{.}\)</p></article></body>
