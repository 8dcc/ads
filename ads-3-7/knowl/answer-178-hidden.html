<p>Basis: \((k=1)\) Is the relation \(r^1\text{,}\) defined by \(v r^1 w\) if there is a path of length 1 from \(v \text{ to } w\text{?}\) Yes, since \(v r w\) if and only if an edge, which is a path of length \(1\text{,}\) connects \(v\) to \(w\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Induction: Assume that \(v r^k w\) if and only if there is a path of length \(k\) from \(v\) to \(w\text{.}\) We must show that \(v r^{k+1} w\) if and only if there is a path of length \(k+1\) from \(v\) to \(w\text{.}\)</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
v r^{k+1} w \Rightarrow v r^k y \textrm{ and } y r w\textrm{ for some vertex } y
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>By the induction hypothesis, there is a path of length \(k\) from \(v \textrm{ to } y\text{.}\) And by the basis, there is a path of length one from \(y\) to \(w\text{.}\) If we combine these two paths, we obtain a path of length \(k+1\) from \(v\) to \(w\text{.}\) Of course, if we start with a path of length \(k+1\) from \(v\) to \(w\text{,}\) we have a path of length \(k\) from \(v\) to some vertex \(y\) and a path of length 1 from \(y\) to \(w\text{.}\) Therefore, \(v r^k y \textrm{ and } y r w \Rightarrow  v r^{k+1} w\text{.}\)</p>
