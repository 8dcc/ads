<p>Note that if a string belongs to \(X_6\text{,}\) it starts with \(k\) characters from \(\{a, b\}\) and is followed by \(6 - k\) characters from \(\{c,
d, e\}\text{.}\) Let \(S(k)\) be the number of strings of \(a\)'s and \(b\)'s with length \(k\) and let \(T(k)\) be the number of strings of \(c\)'s, \(d\)'s, and \(e\)'s with length \(k\text{.}\) By the generalized rule of products, \(S(k) = 2^k\) and \(T(k) = 3^k\text{.}\) Among the strings in \(X_6\) are the ones that start with two \(a\)'s and \(b\)'s and end with \(c\)'s, \(d\)'s, and \(e\)'s. There are \(S(2)T(4)\) such strings. By the law of addition,</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\lvert X_6 \rvert =R(6)=S(0)T(6)+S(1)T(5)+\cdots +S(5)T(1)+S(6)T(0)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Note that the sixth term of R is the sixth term of the convolution of \(S\) with \(T\text{,}\) \(S*T\text{.}\) Think about the general situation for a while and it should be clear that \(R =S*T\text{.}\) Now, our course of action will be to:</p>
