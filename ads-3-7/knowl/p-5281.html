<p>The typical abstract machine includes an input device, the read head, which is capable of reading the symbol from the segment of the input tape that is currently in the read head. Some more advanced machines have a read/write head that can also write symbols onto the tape. The movement of the input tape after reading a symbol depends on the machine. With a finite-state machine, the next segment of the input tape is always moved into the read head after a symbol has been read. Most machines (including finite-state machines) also have a separate output tape that is written on with a write head. The output symbols come from an output alphabet, \(Z\text{,}\) that may or may not be equal to the input alphabet. The most significant component of an abstract machine is its memory structure. This structure can range from a finite number of bits of memory (as in a finite-state machine) to an infinite amount of memory that can be stored in the form of a tape that can be read from and written on (as in a Turing machine).</p>
