<p>From <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/table-s3.html" title="Table 15.3.2: Operation Table for \(S_3\)">TableÂ 15.3.2</a>, we can see that \(S_3\) is non-abelian. Remember, non-abelian is the negation of abelian. The existence of two elements that don't commute is sufficient to make a group non-abelian. In this group, \(r_1\) and \(f_3\) is one such pair: \(r_1\circ f_3= f_2\)  while   \(f_3\circ
r_1= f_1\text{,}\) so \(r_1\circ f_3\neq f_3\circ r_1\text{.}\)   Caution:  Don't take this to mean that every pair of elements has to have this property.  There are several pairs of elements in \(S_3\) that do  commute.  In fact, the identity, \(i\text{,}\) must commute with everything.  Also every element must commute with its inverse.</p>
