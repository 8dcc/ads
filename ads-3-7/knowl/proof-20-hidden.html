<body><article class="hiddenproof"><p>It can be proven by induction that the number of vertices in an undirected graph that have an odd degree must be even. We will leave the proof of this fact to the reader as an exercise. The necessity of having either zero or two vertices of odd degree is clear from the proof of the Koenigsberg case of this theorem. Therefore, we will concentrate on proving that this condition is sufficient to ensure that a graph has an Eulerian path. Let \(k\) be the number of vertices with odd degree.</p>
<p>Phase 1. If \(k = 0\text{,}\) start at any vertex, \(v_0\text{,}\) and travel along any path, not using any edge twice. Since each vertex has an even degree, this path can always be continued past each vertex that you reach except \(v_0\text{.}\) The result is a circuit that includes \(v_0\text{.}\) If \(k =2\text{,}\) let \(v_0\) be either one of the vertices of odd degree. Trace any path starting at \(v_0\) using up edges until you can go no further, as in the \(k = 0\) case. This time, the path that you obtain must end at the other vertex of odd degree that we will call \(v_1\text{.}\)  At the end of Phase 1, we have an initial path that may or may not be Eulerian. If it is not Eulerian, Phase 2 can be repeated until all of the edges have been used.  Since the number of unused edges is decreased in any use of Phase 2, an Eulerian path must be obtained in a finite number of steps.</p>
<p>Phase 2. As we enter this phase, we have constructed a path that uses a proper subset of the edges in our graph. We will refer to this path as the current path. Let \(V\) be the vertices of our graph, \(E\) the edges, and \(E_u\) the edges that have been used in the current path. Consider the graph \(G' = \left(V, E - E_u\right)\text{.}\)  Note that every vertex in \(G'\) has an even degree. Select any edge, \(e\text{,}\) from \(G'.\) Let \(v_a\) and \(v_b\) be the vertices that \(e\) connects. Trace a new path starting at \(v_a\) whose first edge is \(e\text{.}\) We can be sure that at least one vertex of the new path is also in the current path since \((V, E)\) is connected. Starting at \(v_a\text{,}\) there exists a path in \((V, E)\) to any vertex in the current path. At some point along this path, which we can consider the start of the new path, we will have intersected the current path. Since the degree of each vertex in \(G'\) is even, any path that we start at \(v_a\) can be continued until it is a circuit. Now, we simply augment the current path with this circuit. As we travel along the current path, the first time that we intersect the new path, we travel along it (see <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-path-augmentation.html" title="Figure 9.4.8">FigureÂ 9.4.8</a>). Once we complete the circuit that is the new path, we resume the traversal of the current path.</p>
