<p>Suppose that you roll a die two times and add up the numbers on the top face for each roll. Since the faces on the die represent the integers 1 through 6, the sum must be between 2 and 12. How many ways can any one of these sums be obtained? Obviously, 2 can be obtained only one way, with two 1's. There are two sequences that yield a sum of 3: 1-2 and 2-1. To obtain all of the frequencies with which the numbers 2 through 12 can be obtained, we set up the situation as follows. For \(j = 1, 2\text{;}\) \(P_j\) is the rolling of the die for the \(j^{\text{th}}\) time. \(X_j
= \{1, 2, . . . , 6\}\) and \(Q_j : X_j \rightarrow \{0, 1, 2, 3,\ldots \}\) is defined by \(Q_j(x) = x\text{.}\) Since each number appears on a die exactly once, the frequency function is \(F_j(k)=1\) if \(1 \leq  k \leq  6\text{,}\) and \(F_j(k) = 0\) otherwise. The process of rolling the die two times is quantified by adding up the \({Q_j}'s\text{;}\) that is, \(Q\left(a_1, a_2\right) =Q_{1}\left(a_1\right)+Q_2\left(a_2\right)\) . The generating function for the frequency function of rolling the die two times is then</p>
