<p>Early computers relied on many switches to perform the logical operations needed for computation.  This was true as late as the 1970's when early personal computers such as the Altair ( <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-altair.html" title="Figure 13.7.1">FigureÂ 13.7.1</a>) started to appear. Pioneering computer scientists such as Claude Shannon realized that the operation of these computers could be simplified by making use of an isomorphism between computer circuits and boolean algebra.   The term <dfn class="terminology">Switching Theory</dfn> was used at the time.  Logical gates realized through increasingly smaller and smaller integrated circuits still perform the same functions as in early computers, but using purely electronic means.  In this section, we give examples of some switching circuits.  Soon afterward, we will transition to the more modern form of circuits that are studied in <dfn class="terminology">Logic Design</dfn>, where gates replace switches.  Out main goal is to give you an overview of how boolean functions corresponds to any such circuit.  We will introduce the common system notation used in logic design and show how it corresponds with the mathematical notation of Boolean algebras.  Any computer scientist should be familiar with both systems.</p>
