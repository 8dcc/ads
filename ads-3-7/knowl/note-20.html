<li><p>On notation. If two or more consecutive factors in a direct product are identical, it is common to combine them using exponential notation. For example, \(\mathbb{Z} \times  \mathbb{Z} \times  \mathbb{R}\) can be written \(\mathbb{Z}^2 \times  \mathbb{R}\text{,}\) and \(\mathbb{R} \times  \mathbb{R}
\times  \mathbb{R} \times  \mathbb{R}\) can be written \(\mathbb{R}^4\text{.}\) This is purely a notational convenience; no exponentiation is really taking place.</p></li>
<li><p>We call the operations in a direct product <dfn class="terminology">componentwise operations</dfn>, and they are indeed operations on \(V\text{.}\)  If two \(n\)-tuples, \(a\) and \(b\text{,}\) are selected from \(V\text{,}\) the first components of \(a\) and \(b\text{,}\) \(a_1\) and \(b_1\text{,}\) are operated on with \(*_1\) to obtain \(a_1*_1b_1\text{,}\) the first component of \(a * b\text{.}\) Note that since \(*_1\) is an operation on \(V_1\text{,}\) \(a_1*_1b_1\) is an element of \(V_1\text{.}\) Similarly, all other components of \(a * b\text{,}\) as they are defined, belong to their proper sets.</p></li>
<li><p>One significant fact about componentwise operations is that the components of the result can all be computed at the same time (concurrently). The time required to compute in a direct product can be reduced to a length of time that is not much longer than the maximum amount of time needed to compute in the factors.</p></li>
<li><p>A direct product of algebraic systems is not always an algebraic system of the same type as its factors. This is due to the fact that certain axioms that are true for the factors may not be true for the set of \(n\)-tuples. This situation does not occur with groups however. You will find that whenever a new type of algebraic system is introduced, call it type \(T\text{,}\) one of the first theorems that is usually proven, if possible, is that the direct product of two or more systems of type \(T\) is a system of type \(T\text{.}\)</p></li>
