<p>\((3)\Rightarrow (4)\text{.}\) Now we will assume that Statement 3 is true. We must show that \(G\) has no cycles and that adding an edge to \(G\) creates a cycle. We will use an indirect proof for this part. Since (4) is a conjunction, by DeMorgan's Law its negation is a disjunction and we must consider two cases. First, suppose that \(G\) has a cycle. Then the deletion of any edge in the cycle keeps the graph connected, which contradicts (3). The second case is that the addition of an edge to \(G\) does not create a cycle. Then there are two distinct paths between the vertices that the new edge connects. By <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/lemma-two-paths.html" title="Lemma 10.1.10">LemmaÂ 10.1.10</a>, a cycle can then be created, which is a contradiction.</p>
