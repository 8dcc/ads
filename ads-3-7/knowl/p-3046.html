<p>A network of computers can be described easily using a graph.  <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-undirected-1.html" title="Figure 9.1.10">FigureÂ 9.1.10</a> describes a network of five computers, \(a\text{,}\) \(b\text{,}\) \(c\text{,}\) \(d\text{,}\) and \(e\text{.}\) An edge between any two vertices indicates that direct two-way communication is possible between the two computers. Note that the edges of this graph are not directed. This is due to the fact that the relation that is being displayed is symmetric (i.e., if \(X\) can communicate with \(Y\text{,}\) then \(Y\) can communicate with \(X\)). Although directed edges could be used here, it would simply clutter the graph.</p>
