<body><article class="hiddenproof"><p>(\(\Rightarrow\))  In this half of the proof, assume that \(f^{-1}\) exists and we must prove that \(f\) is one-to-one and onto. To do so, it is convenient for us to use the relation notation, where \(f(s)=t\) is equivalent to \((s,t)\in f\text{.}\) To prove that \(f\) is one-to-one, assume that \(f(a)=f(b) = c\text{.}\) Alternatively, that means \((a, c)\) and \((b, c)\) are elements of \(f\) . We must show that \(a =b\text{.}\) Since \((a, b), (c, b) \in \text{  }f\text{,}\) \((c, a)\) and \((c,b)\) are in \(f^{-1}\text{.}\) By the fact that \(f^{-1}\) is a function and \(c\) cannot have two images, \(a\) and \(b\) must be equal, so \(f\) is one-to-one.</p>
<p>Next, to prove that \(f\) is onto, observe that for \(f^{-1}\) to be a function, it must use all of its domain, namely A. Let \(b\) be any element of \(A\text{.}\) Then b has an image under \(f^{-1}\) , \(f^{-1}(b)\text{.}\) Another way of writing this is \(\left(b,f^{-1}(b)\right)\in
f^{-1}\text{,}\) By the definition of the inverse, this is equivalent to \(\left(f^{-1}(b), b\right) \in  f\text{.}\) Hence, \(b\) is in the range of \(f\text{.}\) Since \(b\) was chosen arbitrarily, this shows that the range of \(f \) must be all of \(A\text{.}\)</p>
<p>(\(\Leftarrow\) ) Assume \(f\) is one-to-one and onto and we are to prove \(f^{-1}\) exists. We leave this half of the proof to the reader. \(\square\)</p></article></body>
