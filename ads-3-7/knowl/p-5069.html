<p>The electronics involved in these switches take into account whether we are negating a switch or not.  For electromagnetic switches, a magnet is used to control whether the switch is open or closed. The magnets themselves may be controlled by simple ON/OFF switches.   There are two types of electromagnetic switches.  One is normally open (OFF) when the magnet is not activated, but activating the magnet  will close the circuit and the switch is then ON.  A separate type of switch corresponds with a negated switch. For that type, the switch is closed when the magnet is not activated, and when the magnet is activated, the switch opens.  We won't be overly concerned with the details of these switches or the electronics corresponding to logical gates.  We will simply assume they are available to plug into a circuit.    For simplicity, we use the inversion symbol on a varible that labels a switch to indicate that it is a switch of the second type, as in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-switch-normal-on.html" title="Figure 13.7.3">FigureÂ 13.7.3</a>.</p>
