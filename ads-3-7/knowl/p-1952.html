<p>A typical element in a relation \(r\) is an ordered pair \((x, y)\text{.}\) In some cases, \(r\) can be described by actually listing the pairs which are in \(r\text{,}\) as in the previous examples. This may not be convenient if \(r\) is relatively large. Other notations are used with certain well-known relations. Consider the “less than or equal” relation on the real numbers. We could define it as a set of ordered pairs this way:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\le = \{(x, y) | x \leq  y\}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>However, the notation \(x \leq  y\) is clear and self-explanatory; it is a more natural, and hence preferred, notation to use than \((x, y) \in \le\text{.}\)</p>
