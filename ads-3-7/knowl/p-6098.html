<p>The reader might feel somewhat uncomfortable with the results obtained in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ex-extension-of-z2.html" title="Example 16.4.2: Extending \(\mathbb{Z}_2\)">Example 16.4.2</a>. In particular, what is \(a\text{?}\) Can we describe it through a known quantity? All we know about \(a\) is that it is a zero of \(g(x)\) and that \(a^2= a + 1\text{.}\) We could also say that \(a(a + 1) = 1\text{,}\) but we really expected more. However, should we expect more? In <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ex-irreducible-over-Q-again.html" title="Example 16.4.1: Extending the Rational Numbers">Example 16.4.1</a>, \(\sqrt{2}\) is a number we are more comfortable with, but all we really know about it is that \(\alpha =\sqrt{2}\) is the number such that \(\alpha ^2= 2\text{.}\) Similarly, the zero that the reader will obtain in Exercise 2 of this section is the imaginary number \(i\text{.}\) Here again, this is simply a symbol, and all we know about it is that \(i^2=-1\text{.}\) Hence, the result obtained in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ex-extension-of-z2.html" title="Example 16.4.2: Extending \(\mathbb{Z}_2\)">Example 16.4.2</a> is not really that strange.</p>
