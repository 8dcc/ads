<body><article class="example example-like"><p>A club has eight members eligible to serve as president, vice-president, and treasurer. How many ways are there of choosing these officers?</p>
<p>Solution 1: Using the rule of products. There are eight possible choices for the presidency, seven for the vice-presidency, and six for the office of treasurer. By the rule of products there are \(8 \cdot 7\cdot 6 = 336\) ways of choosing these officers.</p>
<p>Solution 2: Using the permutation formula. We want the total number of permutations of eight objects taken three at a time:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
P(8,3)=\frac{8!}{(8-3)!}=8 \cdot 7 \cdot 6 = 336
\end{equation*}
