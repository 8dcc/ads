<p>Assume that \([G;*]\) and \([H;\diamond ]\) are groups. The following are reasons for \(G\) and \(H\) to be not isomorphic.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>\(G\) and \(H\) do not have the same cardinality. For example, \(\mathbb{Z}_{12} \times  \mathbb{Z}_5\) can't be isomorphic to \(\mathbb{Z}_{50}\) and \([\mathbb{R};+]\) can't be isomorphic to \(\left[\mathbb{Q}^+ ; \cdot \right]\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>\(G\) is abelian and \(H\) is not abelian since \(a * b = b * a\) is always true in \(G\text{,}\) but \(T(a) \diamond  T(b) = T(b) \diamond T(a)\) would not always be true. We have seen  two groups with six elements that apply here.  They are \(\mathbb{Z}_6\) and the group of \(3 \times  3\) rook matrices (see <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ex-rook-matrices.html" title="Exercise 11.2.4.5">Exercise 11.2.4.5</a>). The second group is non-abelian, therefore it can't be isomorphic to \(\mathbb{Z}_6\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>\(G\) has a certain kind of subgroup that \(H\) doesn't have. Part (c) of <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/theorem-isomorphism-properties.html" title="Theorem 11.7.14: Properties of Isomorphisms">Theorem 11.7.14</a> states that this cannot happen if \(G\) is isomorphic to \(H\text{.}\) \(\left[\mathbb{R}^* ; \cdot \right]\) and \(\left[\mathbb{R}^+ ; \cdot \right]\) are not isomorphic since \(\mathbb{R}^*\) has a subgroup with two elements, \(\{-1, 1\}\text{,}\) while the proper subgroups of \(\mathbb{R}^+\) are all infinite (convince yourself of this fact!).</p></li>
<li><p>The number of solutions of \(x * x = e\) in \(G\) is not equal to the number of solutions of \(y \diamond  y = e'\) in \(H\text{.}\) \(\mathbb{Z}_8\) is not isomorphic to \(\mathbb{Z}_2{}^3\) since \(x +_8 x = 0\) has two solutions, 0 and 4, while \(y + y = (0, 0, 0)\) is true for all \(y\in \mathbb{Z}_2{}^3\text{.}\) If the operation in \(G\) is defined by a table, then the number of solutions of \(x * x = e\) will be the number of occurrences of \(e\) in the main diagonal of the table. The equations \(x^3 = e\text{,}\) \(x^4= e, \dots\)  can also be used in the same way to identify pairs of non-isomorphic groups.</p></li>
<li><p>One of the cyclic subgroups of \(G\) equals \(G\) (i. e., \(G\) is cyclic), while none of \(H\)'s cyclic subgroups equals \(H\) (i. e., \(H\) is noncyclic). This is a special case of Condition c. \(\mathbb{Z}\) and \(\mathbb{Z} \times  \mathbb{Z}\) are not isomorphic since \(\mathbb{Z} = \langle 1\rangle\) and \(\mathbb{Z} \times  \mathbb{Z}\) is not cyclic.</p></li>
