<p>A common occurrence of a multigraph is a road map. The cities and towns on the map can be thought of as vertices, while the roads are the edges. It is not uncommon to have more than one road connecting two cities. In order to give clear travel directions, we name or number roads so that there is no ambiguity. We use the same method to describe the edges of the multigraph in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-multigraph-ex1.html" title="Figure 9.1.7">FigureÂ 9.1.7</a>. There is no question what \(e3\) is; however, referring to the edge \((2, 3)\) would be ambiguous.</p>
