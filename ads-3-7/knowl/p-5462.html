<p>Although we have seen that any representative can describe a coset, it is often convenient to select a distinguished representative from each coset. The advantage to doing this is that there is a unique name for each coset in terms of its distinguished representative. In numeric examples such as the one above, the distinguished representative is usually the smallest nonnegative representative. Remember, this is purely a convenience and there is absolutely nothing wrong in writing \(-203+4\mathbb{Z}\text{,}\) \(5+4\mathbb{Z}\text{,}\) or \(621+4\mathbb{Z}\) in place of \(1+4\mathbb{Z}\)  because  \(-203, 5, 621 \in 1+4\mathbb{Z}\text{.}\)</p>
