<p>Consider the rings \([\mathbb{Z}; +, \cdot ]\) and \([2\mathbb{Z}; +, \cdot ]\text{.}\) In Chapter 11 we showed that as groups, the two sets \(\mathbb{Z}\) and 2\(\mathbb{Z}\) with addition were isomorphic. The group isomorphism that proved this was the function \(f : \mathbb{Z} \to 2\mathbb{Z}\text{,}\) defined by \(f(n) = 2n\text{.}\)  Is \(f\) a ring isomorphism? We need only check whether \(f(m\cdot n) = f(m)\cdot f(n)\) for all \(m, n \in \mathbb{Z}\text{.}\)  In fact, this condition is not satisfied:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
f(m\cdot n) = 2\cdot m\cdot n \quad\textrm{ and }\quad
f(m)\cdot f(n)=2m\cdot 2n= 4\cdot m \cdot n
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Therefore,  \(f\) is not a ring isomorphism. This does not necessarily mean that the two rings \(\mathbb{Z}\) and 2\(\mathbb{Z}\) are not isomorphic, but simply that \(f\) doesn't satisfy the conditions.  We could imagine that some other function does. We could  try to find another function that is a ring isomorphism, or we could try to show that \(\mathbb{Z}\) and 2\(\mathbb{Z}\) are not isomorphic as rings. To do the latter, we must find something different about the ring structure of \(\mathbb{Z}\) and 2\(\mathbb{Z}\text{.}\)</p>
