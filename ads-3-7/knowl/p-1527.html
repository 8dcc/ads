<p>Since each entry in Column 7 is the same as the corresponding entry in Column 8, we have shown that \(A\cap  (B \cup  C) = (A\cap B) \cup  (A \cap C)\) for any sets \(A\text{,}\) \(B\text{,}\) and \(C\text{.}\) The main advantage of this method is that it is mechanical. The main disadvantage is that it is reasonable to use only for a relatively small number of sets. If we are trying to prove a statement involving five sets, there are \(2^5 = 32\) rows, which would test anyone's patience doing the work by hand.</p>
