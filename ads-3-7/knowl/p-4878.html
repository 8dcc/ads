<p>In Chapter 1, we defined the complement of a subset of any universe.   This turns out to be a concrete example of the general concept we have just defined, but we will reason through why this is the case here.  Let \(L = \mathcal{P}(A)\text{,}\) where \(A = \{a, b, c\}\text{.}\) Then \([L; \cup  , \cap ]\) is a bounded lattice with \(0 = \emptyset\) and \(1 = A\text{.}\) To find the complement, if it exists, of \(B = \{a, b\} \in  L\text{,}\) for example, we want \(D\) such that</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{c}
\{a,b\} \cap D = \emptyset\\ 
and\\
\{a,b\} \cup  D = A\\
\end{array}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>It's not too difficult to see that  \(D = \{c\}\text{,}\) since we need to include \(c\) to make the first condition true and can't include \(a\) or \(b\) if the second condition is to be true.  Of course this is precisely how we defined \(A^c\) in Chapter 1.  Since it can be shown that each element of \(L\) has a complement (see Exercise 1), \([L; \cup  , \cap ]\) is a complemented lattice. Note that if \(A\) is any set and \(L = \mathcal{P}(A)\text{,}\) then \([L; \cup  , \cap ]\) is a complemented lattice where the complement of \(B \in  L\) is \(B ^c = A - B\text{.}\)</p>
