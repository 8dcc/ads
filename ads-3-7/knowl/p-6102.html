<p>First, we start with the irreducible polynomial \(p(x)=x^3 + x + 1\) over \(\mathbb{Z}_2\text{.}\) There is another such cubic polynomial, but its choice produces essentially the same result.    Just as we did in the previous example, we assume we have a zero of \(p(x)\) and call it  \(\beta\text{.}\)  Since we have assumed that \(p(\beta)= \beta^3+\beta + 1=0\text{,}\) we get the recurrence relation for powers \(\beta^3=\beta + 1\) that lets us reduce the seven powers \(\beta^k\text{,}\) \(0 \leq k \leq 6\text{,}\) to  linear combinations of 1, \(\beta\text{,}\) and \(\beta^2\text{.}\) Higher powers will reduce to these seven, which make up the elements of a field with \(2^3=8\) elements when we add zero to the set.   We leave as an exercise for you to set up a table relating powers of \(\beta\) with the linear combinations.</p>
