<p>Suppose that the information about edges in a graph is stored in an adjacency matrix, \(G\text{.}\) The relation, \(r\text{,}\) that \(G\) defines is \(v r w\) if there is an edge connecting \(v\) to \(w\text{.}\) Recall that the composition of \(r\) with itself, \(r^2\text{,}\) is defined by \(v r^2 w\) if there exists a vertex \(y\) such that \(v r y\) and \(y r w\text{;}\) that is, \(v\) is connected to \(w\) by a path of length 2. We could prove by induction that the relation \(r^k\text{,}\) \(k\geq 1\text{,}\) is defined by \(v r^k w\) if and only if there is a path of length \(k\) from \(v\) to \(w\text{.}\) Since the transitive closure, \(r^+\text{,}\) is the union of \(r\text{,}\) \(r^2\) \(,r^3,\ldots\text{,}\) we can answer our connectivity question by determining the transitive closure of \(r\text{,}\) which can be done most easily by keeping our relation in matrix form. <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/theorem-9-3-1.html" title="Theorem 9.3.2: Maximal Path Theorem">TheoremÂ 9.3.2</a> is significant in our calculations because it tells us that we need only go as far as \(G^n\) to determine the matrix of the transitive closure.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s-Connectivity.html#algorithm-6">in-context</a></span>
