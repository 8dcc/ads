<p>First the field must contain the additive and multiplicative identities, 0 and 1, so, without loss of generality, we can assume that the field we are looking for is of the form \(F = \{0, 1, a, b\}\text{.}\)  Since there are only two nonisomorphic groups of order 4, we have only two choices for the group table for \([F; +]\text{.}\)   If the additive group is isomorphic to \(\mathbb{Z}_4\) then two of the nonzero elements of \(F\) would not be their own additive inverse (as are 1 and 3 in \(\mathbb{Z}_4\)).   Let's assume \(\beta \in F\) is one of those elements and \(\beta +\beta =\gamma \neq 0\text{.}\)  An isomorphism between the additive groups \(F\) and  \(\mathbb{Z}_4\) would require that \(\gamma\) in \(F\)  correspond with 2 in  \(\mathbb{Z}_4\text{.}\)  We could continue our argument and infer that \(\gamma \cdot \gamma =0\text{,}\) producing a zero divisor, which we need to avoid if \(F\) is to be a field.   We leave the remainder of the argument to the reader.   We can thus complete the addition table so that \([F;+]\) is isomorphic to \(\mathbb{Z}_2{}^2\text{:}\)</p>
