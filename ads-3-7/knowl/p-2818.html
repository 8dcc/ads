<p>This homogeneous second-order linear relation with variable coefficients, together with the initial conditions \(D(1) = 0\) and \(D(2) = 1\text{,}\) completely defines \(D\text{.}\) Instead of deriving a solution of this relation by analytical methods, we will give an empirical derivation of an approximation of \(D(n)\text{.}\) Since the derangements of \(\{1,2 . . . , n\}\) are drawn from a pool of \(n!\) permutations, we will see what percentage of these permutations are derangements by listing the values of \(n!\text{,}\) \(D(n)\text{,}\) and \(\frac{D(n)}{n!}\text{.}\)  The results we observe will indicate that as \(n\) grows, \(\frac{D(n)}{n!}\) hardly changes at all. If this quotient is computed to eight decimal places, for \(n \geq  12\text{,}\) \(D(n)/n!
= 0.36787944\text{.}\) The reciprocal of this number, which \(D(n)/n!\) seems to be tending toward, is, to eight places, 2.7182818. This number appears in so many places in mathematics that it has its own name, \(e\text{.}\) An approximate solution of our recurrence relation on \(D\) is then \(D(n)\approx \frac{n!}{e}\text{.}\)</p>
