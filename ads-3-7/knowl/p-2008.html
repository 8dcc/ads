<ul class="disc">
<li><p>Every element in \(B\) divides itself and is less than or equal to itself. This is called the reflexive property.</p></li>
<li><p>If we search for two elements from \(B\) where the first divides the second and the second divides the first, then we are forced to choose the two numbers to be the same. In other words, no two <em class="emphasis">different</em> numbers are related in both directions. The reader can verify that a similar fact is true for the relation \(\leq \) on \(B\text{.}\) This is called the antisymmetric property.</p></li>
<li><p>Next if we choose three values (not necessarily distinct) from \(B\) such that the first divides the second and the second divides the third, then we always find that the first number divides the third.  Again, the same is true if we replace “divides” with “is less than or equal to.” This is called the transitive property.</p></li>
