<p>Let \(v\) and \(w\) be vertices of a directed graph. Vertex \(v\) is  connected to vertex \(w\) if there is a path from \(v\) to \(w\text{.}\) Two vertices are  strongly connected if they are connected in both directions to one another. A  graph is connected if, for each pair of distinct vertices, \(v\) and \(w\text{,}\) \(v\) is connected to \(w\)  or \(w\) is connected to \(v\text{.}\) A  graph is strongly connected if every pair of its vertices is strongly connected. For an undirected graph, in which edges can be used in either direction, the notions of strongly connected and connected are the same.</p>
