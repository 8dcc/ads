<p>To summarize the procedure in the Gauss-Jordan technique for solving systems of equations, we attempt to obtain 1's along the main diagonal of the coefficient matrix with 0's above and below the diagonal. We may find in attempting this that this objective cannot be completed, as in the last two examples we have seen.  Depending on the way we interpret the results in equation form, we either recognize that no solution exists, or we identity “free variables” on which an infinite number of solutions are based.  The final matrix forms that we have produced in our examples are referred to as  <dfn class="terminology">echelon forms</dfn>.</p>
