<p>Typically, these objectives are not compatible; that is, you cannot always simultaneously achieve these objectives. In the case of the Atlantis university system, the solution with respect to Objective 1 is indicated with solid lines in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-atlantis-10.html" title="Figure 10.2.1">Figure 10.2.1</a>. There are four solutions to the problem with respect to Objective 2: any tree in which one campus is directly connected to the other three. One solution with respect to Objective 2 is indicated with dotted lines in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-atlantis-10.html" title="Figure 10.2.1">Figure 10.2.1</a>. After satisfying the conditions of Objective 2, it would seem reasonable to select the cheapest of the four trees.</p>
