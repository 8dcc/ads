<p>A Word Of Caution: Frequently we may can get “different-looking” answers to the same problem when a system has an infinite number of solutions. Assume the solutions set in this example is reported to be \(A = \left\{\left(1+16x_2, x_2, -11x_3\right) \mid x_3\in \mathbb{R}\right\}\text{.}\) Certainly the result described by \(S\) looks different from that described by \(A\text{.}\) To see whether they indeed describe the same set, we wish to determine whether every solution produced in \(S\) can be generated in \(A\text{.}\) For example, the solution generated by \(S\) when \(x_3=11\) is \((-15, -1, 11)\text{.}\) The same triple can be produced by \(A\) by taking \(x_2= -1\text{.}\) We must prove that every solution described in \(S\) is described in \(A\) and, conversely, that every solution described in \(A\) is described in \(S\text{.}\) (See Exercise 6 of this section.)</p>
