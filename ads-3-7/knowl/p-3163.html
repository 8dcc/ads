<p>This section is devoted to a question that, when posed in relation to the graphs that we have examined, seems trivial. That question is: Given two vertices, \(s\) and \(t\text{,}\) of a graph, is there a path from \(s\) to  \(t\text{?}\)  If \(s = t\text{,}\) this question is interpreted as asking whether there is a circuit of positive length starting at \(s\text{.}\) Of course, for the graphs we have seen up to now, this question can be answered after a brief examination.</p>
