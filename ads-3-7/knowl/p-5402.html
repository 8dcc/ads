<p>The computation of \(\theta^{-1}\left(s_1,s_2,s_3\right)\) that is done by the Sage function <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">crt</code> can be accomplished in a variety of ways. All of them ultimately are simplified by the fact that \(\theta^{-1}\) is also an isomorphism. One approach is to use the isomorphism property to realize that the value of \(\theta^{-1}\left(s_1,s_2,s_3\right)\) is \(s_1\theta^{-1}(1,0,0)+s_2\theta^{-1}(0,1,0)+s_3\theta^{-1}(0,0,1)\text{.}\) The arithmetic in this expression is in the domain of \(\theta\) and is more time consuming, but it need only be done once. This is why the fast adder is only practical in situations where many additions must be performed to get a single sum.</p>
