<body><article class="hiddenproof"><p>Case 1. Given the alphabet \(B=\{0,1\}\text{,}\) we can define a bijection from the positive integers into \(B^*\text{.}\) Each positive integer has a binary expansion \(d_kd_{k-1}\cdots d_1d_0\text{,}\) where each \(d_j\) is 0 or 1 and \(d_k=1\text{.}\) If \(n\) has such a binary expansion, then \(2^k \leq n\leq 2^{k+1}\text{.}\) We define \(f:\mathbb{P}\to B^*\) by \(f(n)=f\left(d_kd_{k-1}\cdots  d_1d_0\right)=d_{k-1}\cdots d_1d_0,\)  where  \(f(1)=\lambda\text{.}\) Every one of the \(2^k\) strings of length \(k\) are the images of exactly one of the integers between \(2^k\textrm{ and } 2^{k+1}-1.\) From its definition, \(f\) is clearly a bijection; therefore, \(B^*\) is countable.</p>
<p>Case 2: \(A\) is Finite. We will describe how this case is handled with an example first and then give the general proof. If \(A=\{a,b,c,d,e\}\text{,}\) then we can code the letters in \(A\) into strings from \(B^3\text{.}\) One of the coding schemes (there are many) is \(a\leftrightarrow 000, b\leftrightarrow
001, c\leftrightarrow 010, d\leftrightarrow 011, \textrm{ and } e\leftrightarrow 100\text{.}\) Now every string in \(A^*\) corresponds to a different string in \(B^*\text{;}\) for example, \(ace\text{.}\)  would correspond with \(000010100\text{.}\) The cardinality of \(A^*\) is equal to the cardinality of the set of strings that can be obtained from this encoding system. The possible coded strings must be countable, since they are a subset of a countable set, \(B^*\text{.}\) Therefore, \(A^*\) is countable.</p>
<p>If \(\lvert A\rvert =m\text{,}\) then the letters in \(A\) can be coded using a set of fixed-length strings from \(B^*\text{.}\) If \(2^{k-1} &lt; m \leq 2^k\text{,}\) then there are at least as many strings of length \(k\) in \(B^k\) as there are letters in \(A\text{.}\) Now we can associate each letter in \(A\) with with a different element of \(B^k\text{.}\) Then any string in \(A^*\text{.}\)  corresponds to a string in \(B^*\text{.}\)  By the same reasoning as in the example above, \(A^*\) is countable.</p>
<p>Case 3: \(A\) is Countably Infinite. We will leave this case as an exercise.</p></article></body>
