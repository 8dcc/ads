<body><article class="example example-like"><p>Consider the polynomial \(g(x) = x^2 + x + 1 \in  \mathbb{Z}_2[x]\text{.}\) Let's repeat  the steps from the previous example to factor \(g(x)\text{.}\) First, \(g(0) = 1\) and \(g(1) = 1\text{,}\) so none of the elements of \(\mathbb{Z}_2\) are zeros of \(g(x)\text{.}\) Hence, the zeros of \(g(x)\) must lie in an extension field of \(\mathbb{Z}_2\text{.}\) By <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/theorem-max-zeros.html" title="Theorem 16.3.15">Theorem 16.3.15</a>, \(g(x) = x^2 + x + 1\) can have at most two zeros. Let \(a\) be a zero of \(g(x)\text{.}\) Then the extension field \(S\) of \(\mathbb{Z}_2\) must contain, besides \(a\text{,}\) \(a \cdot a = a^2\text{,}\) \(a^3\text{,}\) \(a + a\text{,}\)  \(a+1\text{,}\) and so on. But, since \(g(a) = 0\text{,}\) we have \(a^2 + a + 1 = 0\text{,}\) or equivalently, \(a^2= -(a+1)=a+1\) (remember, we are working in an extension of \(\mathbb{Z}_2\)). We can use this recurrence relation to reduce powers of \(a\text{.}\) So far our extension field, \(S\text{,}\) of \(\mathbb{Z}_2\) must contain the set \(\{0, 1, a, a + 1\}\text{,}\) and we claim that this the complete extension. For \(S\) to be a field, all possible sums, products, and differences of elements in \(S\) must be in \(S\text{.}\) Let's try a few:  \(a + a = a\left(1 +_2 1\right)=a\cdot 0=0\in S\) Since \(a+a=0\text{,}\)  \(-a = a\text{,}\) which is in \(S\text{.}\)  Adding three \(a\)'s together doesn't give us anything new: \(a + a + a = a\in
S\)   In fact, \(n a\) is in \(S\) for all possible positive integers \(n\text{.}\)  Next,</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split} a^3 &amp; = a^2 \cdot  a \\
&amp; = (a +1)\cdot a \\
&amp;  = a^2+ a\\
&amp;  = (a+1)+a\\
&amp;  =1 \\
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Therefore,  \(a^{-1}= a+1 = a^2\)   and \((a+1)^{-1}=a\text{.}\)</p>
<p>It is not difficult to see that \(a^n\) is in \(S\) for all positive \(n\text{.}\)  Does \(S\) contain all zeros of \(x^2 + x + 1\text{?}\) Remember, \(g(x)\) can have at most two distinct zeros and we called one of them \(a\text{,}\) so if there is a second, it must be \(a + 1\text{.}\) To see if \(a + 1\) is indeed a zero of \(g(x)\text{,}\) simply compute \(f(a + 1)\text{:}\)</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
f(a+1) &amp; = (a + 1)^2 + (a+1) + 1\\
&amp;= a ^2 +1 + a+1+ 1 \\
&amp; =a^2+a + 1\\
&amp; =0\\
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Therefore, \(a + 1\) is also a zero of \(x^2 + x + 1\text{.}\) Hence, \(S = \{0, 1, a, a + 1\}\) is the smallest field that contains \(\mathbb{Z}_2 = \{0, 1\}\) as a subfield and contains all zeros of \(x^2 + x + 1\text{.}\) This extension field is denoted by \(\mathbb{Z}_2(a)\text{.}\) Note that \(x^2 + x + 1\) splits in \(\mathbb{Z}_2(a)\text{;}\) that is, it factors into linear factors in \(\mathbb{Z}_2(a)\text{.}\) We also observe that \(\mathbb{Z}_2(a)\) is a field containing exactly four elements. By <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/theorem-number-of-fields.html" title="Theorem 16.2.10">Theorem 16.2.10</a>, we expected that \(\mathbb{Z}_2(a)\) would be of order \(p^2\) for some prime \(p\) and positive integer \(n\text{.}\) Also recall that all fields of order \(p^n\) are isomorphic. Hence, we have described all fields of order \(2^2 =4\) by finding the extension field of a polynomial that is irreducible over \(\mathbb{Z}_2\text{.}\)</p></article></body>
