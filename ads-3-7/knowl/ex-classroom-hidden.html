<body><article class="example example-like"><p>Let \(A\) be the set of students who are sitting in a classroom,  let \(B\) be the set of seats in the classroom, and let \(s\) be the function which maps each student into the chair he or she is sitting in. When is \(s\) one to one? When is it onto? Under normal circumstances, \(s\)  would always be injective since no two different students would be in the same seat.  In order for \(s\) to be surjective, we need all seats to be used, so \(s\)  is a surjection if the classroom is filled to capacity.</p></article></body>
