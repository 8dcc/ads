<p>The determination of \(C_k\) is a standard kind of problem in combinatorics. One solution is by way of a recurrence relation. In fact, many problems in combinatorics are most easily solved by first searching for a recurrence relation and then solving it. The following observation will suggest the recurrence relation that we need to determine \(C_k\text{.}\) If \(k \geq  2\text{,}\) then every string of 0's and 1's with length \(k\) and no two consecutive 0's is either \(1s_{k-1}\) or \(01s_{k-2}\text{,}\) where \(s_{k-1}\) and \(s_{k-2}\) are strings with no two consecutive 0's of length \(k - 1\) and \(k - 2\) respectively. From this observation we can see that \(C_k= C_{k-2}+C_{k-1}\) for \(k\geq 2\text{.}\) The terms \(C_0=
1\) and \(C_1 = 2\) are easy to determine by enumeration. Now, by iteration, any \(C_k\) can be easily determined. For example, \(C_5 = 21\) can be computed with five additions. A closed form expression for \(C_k\) would be an improvement. Note that the recurrence relation for \(C_k\) is identical to the one for <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ex-fibonacci-sequence.html" title="Example 8.1.8: The Fibonacci Sequence">The Fibonacci Sequence</a>.
