<p>A poker game is played with 52 cards.  At the start of a game, each player gets five of the cards.  The order in which cards are dealt doesn't matter.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>How many “hands” of five cards are possible?</p></li>
<li><p>If there are four people playing, how many initial five-card “hands” are possible, taking into account all players and their positions at the table?  Position with respect to the dealer does matter.</p></li>
</ol>
