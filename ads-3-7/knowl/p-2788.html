<p>Any discussion of logarithms must start by establishing a base, which can be any positive number other than 1. With the exception of <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/theorem-logs-related.html" title="Theorem 8.4.5: How logarithms with different bases are related">TheoremÂ 5</a>, our base will be 2. We will see that the use of a different base (10 and \(e\approx  2.171828\) are the other common ones) only has the effect of multiplying each logarithm by a constant. Therefore, the base that you use really isn't very important. Our choice of base 2 logarithms is convenient for the problems that we are considering.</p>
