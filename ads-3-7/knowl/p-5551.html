<p>What is the operation on this set of symmetries?   We will call the operation “followed by” and use the symbol \(*\)  to represent it.  The operation will be to combine motions, applying motions from right to left, as with functions.  We will illustrate how \(*\) is computed by finding  \(r_1*f_1\text{.}\)  Starting with the initial configuration, if you perform the \(f_1\) motion, and then immediately perform \(r_1\) on the result, we get the same configuration as if we just performed \(f_4\text{,}\) which is to flip the square along the line \(l_4\text{.}\)   Therefore, \(r_1*f_1 = f_4\text{.}\)  An important observation is that \(f_1*r_1 \neq f_4\text{,}\) meaning that this group is nonabelian. The reader is encouraged to verify this on their own.</p>
