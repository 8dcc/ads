<p>  Let \(B^*\) be the set of all finite strings of 0's and 1's including the null (or empty) string, \(\lambda\text{.}\) An algebraic system is obtained by adding the operation of concatenation. The concatenation of two strings is simply the linking of the two strings together in the order indicated. The concatenation of strings \(a\) with \(b\) is denoted \(a+b\text{.}\)  For example, \(01101+101 =01101101\) and \(\lambda +100 = 100\text{.}\) Note that concatenation is an associative operation and that \(\lambda\)  is the identity for concatenation.</p>
<p>A note on notation:  There isn't a standard symbol for concatenation.  We have chosen \(+\) to be consistent with the notation used in Python and Sage for the concatenation.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Let \(M\) be any nonempty set and let * be any operation on \(M\) that is associative and has an identity in \(M\text{.}\)</p></li>
