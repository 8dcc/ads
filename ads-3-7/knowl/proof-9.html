<p>Commentary: The usual and first approach would be to assume \(A\subseteq B\) and \(B\cap C = \emptyset\) is true and to attempt to prove \(A\cap C = \emptyset\) is true. To do this you would need to show that nothing is contained in the set \(A \cap  C\text{.}\) Think about how you would show that something doesn't exist. It is very difficult to do directly.</p>
<p>The Indirect Method is much easier: If we assume the conclusion is false and we obtain a contradiction ---  then the theorem must be true. This approach is on sound logical footing since it is exactly the same method of indirect proof that we discussed in <a href="s-math-systems.html#sub-indirect-proof" class="internal" title="Subsection 3.5.3: Indirect Proof">SubsectionÂ 3.5.3</a>.</p>
<p>Assume \(A\subseteq B\) and \(B\cap C = \emptyset\text{,}\) and \(A\cap C \neq  \emptyset\text{.}\) To prove that this cannot occur, let \(x\in A \cap C\text{.}\)</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
x \in A \cap C &amp; \Rightarrow x \in A \textrm{ and } x \in  C\\
&amp; \Rightarrow x \in B \textrm{ and } x \in  C\\
&amp; \Rightarrow x \in  B \cap C
\end{split}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>But this contradicts the second premise.  Hence, the theorem is proven.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s-laws-of-set-theory.html#proof-9">in-context</a></span>
