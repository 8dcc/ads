<p>Although the closest neighbor circuit is often not optimal, we may be satisfied if it is close to optimal. If \(C_{opt}\) and \(C_{cn}\) are the costs of optimal and closest neighbor circuits in a graph, then it is always the case that \(C_{opt}\leq C_{cn}\) or \(\frac{C_{cn}}{C_{opt}}\geq
1\text{.}\) We can assess how good the closest neighbor algorithm is by determining how small the quantity \(\frac{C_{cn}}{C_{opt}}\) gets. If it is always near 1, then the algorithm is good. However, if there are graphs for which it is large, then the algorithm may be discarded. Note that in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ex-tsp-small-example.html" title="Example 9.5.6: A small example">ExampleÂ 9.5.6</a>, \(\frac{C_{cn}}{C_{opt}} = \frac{29}{27}\approx 1.074\text{.}\) A 7 percent increase in cost may or may not be considered significant, depending on the situation.</p>
