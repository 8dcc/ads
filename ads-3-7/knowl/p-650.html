<p>Note that \(4!\) is 4 times \(3!\text{,}\) or 24, and \(5!\) is 5 times \(4!\text{,}\) or 120. In addition, note that as \(n\) grows in size, \(n!\) grows extremely quickly. For example, \(11! = 39916800\text{.}\) If the answer to a problem happens to be \(25!\text{,}\) as in the previous example, you would never be expected to write that number out completely. However, a problem with an answer of \(\frac{25!}{23!}\) can be reduced to \(25 \cdot 24\text{,}\) or 600.</p>
