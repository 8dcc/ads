<body><article class="example example-like"><p>Next consider whether \([2\mathbb{Z};+,\cdot]\) and \([3\mathbb{Z}; +, \cdot ]\) are isomorphic. Because of the previous example, we might  guess that they are not.   However, checklist items 1 through 3 above do not help us. Why? We add another checklist item:</p>
<p>4.  Find an equation that makes sense in both rings, which is solvable in one and not the other.</p>
<p>The equation \(x + x = x \cdot  x\text{,}\)  or \(2x=x^2\text{,}\) makes sense in both rings. However, this equation has a nonzero solution, \(x = 2\text{,}\) in \(2\mathbb{Z}\text{,}\) but does not have a nonzero solution in \(3\mathbb{Z}\text{.}\) Thus we have an equation solvable in one ring that cannot be solved in the other, so they cannot be isomorphic.</p></article></body>
