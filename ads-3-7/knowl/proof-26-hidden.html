<body><article class="hiddenproof"><p>(\(\Rightarrow\)) Let \(G = (V, E)\) be a bipartite graph that is partitioned into two sets,  R(ed) and  B(lue) that define a 2-coloring. Consider any circuit in \(V\text{.}\) If we specify a direction in the circuit and define  \(f\) on the vertices of the circuit by</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
f(u) = \textrm{the next vertex in the circuit after } v
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Note that \(f\) is a bijection. Hence the number of red vertices in the circuit equals the number of blue vertices, and so the length of the circuit must be even.</p>
<p>(\(\Longleftarrow\)) Assume that \(G\) has no circuit of odd length. For each component of \(G\text{,}\) select any vertex \(w\) and color it red. Then for every other vertex \(v\) in the component, find the path of shortest distance from \(w\) to \(v\text{.}\) If the length of the path is odd, color \(v\) blue, and if it is even, color \(v\) red. We claim that this method defines a 2-coloring of \(G\text{.}\) Suppose that it does not define a 2-coloring. Then let \(v_a\) and \(v_b\) be two vertices with identical colors that are connected with an edge. By the way that we colored \(G\text{,}\) neither \(v_a\) nor \(v_{b }\) could equal \(w\text{.}\)  We can now construct a circuit with an odd length in \(G\text{.}\) First, we start at \(w\) and follow the shortest path to \(v_a\) . Then follow the edge \(\left(v_a,v_b\right)\text{,}\) and finally, follow the reverse of a shortest path from \(w\) to \(v_b\text{.}\) Since \(v_a\) and \(v_b\) have the same color, the first and third segments of this circuit have lengths that are both odd or even, and the sum of their lengths must be even. The addition of the single edge \(\left(v_a,v_b\right)\) shows us that this circuit has an odd length. This contradicts our premise.</p></article></body>
