<p>The major league baseball championship is decided with a single-elimination tournament, where each “game” is actually a series of games. From 1969 to 1994, the two divisional champions in the American League (East and West) competed in a series of games. The loser is eliminated and the winner competed against the winner of the National League series (which is decided as in the American League). The tournament graph of the 1983 championship is in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-mlb-1983-9-1.html" title="Figure 9.1.26">Figure 9.1.26</a></p>
