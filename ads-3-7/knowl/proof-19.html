<p>The map of Koenigsberg can be represented as an undirected multigraph, as in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-konigsberg-multigraph.html" title="Figure 9.4.2">FigureÂ 9.4.2</a>. The four land masses are the vertices and each edge represents a bridge.</p>
<p>The desired tour is then a path that uses each edge once and only once. Since the path can start and end at two different vertices, there are two remaining vertices that must be intermediate vertices in the path. If \(x\) is an intermediate vertex, then every time that you visit \(x\text{,}\) you must use two of its incident edges, one to enter and one to exit. Therefore, there must be an even number of edges connecting \(x\) to the other vertices. Since every vertex in the Koenigsberg graph has an odd number of edges, no tour of the type that is desired is possible.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s-traversals.html#proof-19">in-context</a></span>
