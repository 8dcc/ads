<body><article class="example example-like"><p>Consider the rings \([\mathbb{Z}; +, \cdot ]\) and \([2\mathbb{Z}; +, \cdot ]\text{.}\) In Chapter 11 we showed that as groups, the two sets \(\mathbb{Z}\) and 2\(\mathbb{Z}\) with addition were isomorphic. The group isomorphism that proved this was the function \(f : \mathbb{Z} \to 2\mathbb{Z}\text{,}\) defined by \(f(n) = 2n\text{.}\)  Is \(f\) a ring isomorphism? We need only check whether \(f(m\cdot n) = f(m)\cdot f(n)\) for all \(m, n \in \mathbb{Z}\text{.}\)  In fact, this condition is not satisfied:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
f(m\cdot n) = 2\cdot m\cdot n \quad\textrm{ and }\quad
f(m)\cdot f(n)=2m\cdot 2n= 4\cdot m \cdot n
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Therefore,  \(f\) is not a ring isomorphism. This does not necessarily mean that the two rings \(\mathbb{Z}\) and 2\(\mathbb{Z}\) are not isomorphic, but simply that \(f\) doesn't satisfy the conditions.  We could imagine that some other function does. We could  try to find another function that is a ring isomorphism, or we could try to show that \(\mathbb{Z}\) and 2\(\mathbb{Z}\) are not isomorphic as rings. To do the latter, we must find something different about the ring structure of \(\mathbb{Z}\) and 2\(\mathbb{Z}\text{.}\)</p>
<p>We already know that they behave identically under addition, so if they are different as rings, it must have something to do with how they behave under the operation of multiplication. Let's begin to develop a checklist of how the two rings could differ:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>Do they have the same cardinality? Yes, they are both countable.</p></li>
<li><p>Are they both commutative? Yes.</p></li>
<li><p>Are they both rings with unity? No.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>\(\mathbb{Z}\) is a ring with unity, namely the number 1.   2\(\mathbb{Z}\) is not a ring with unity, \(1\notin 2\mathbb{Z}\text{.}\)  Hence, they are not isomorphic as rings.</p></article></body>
