<p>The 3-cube and its generalization, the \(n\)-cube, play a role in the design of a multiprocessor called a hypercube. A multiprocessor is a computer that consists of several independent processors that can operate simultaneously and are connected to one another by a network of connections. In a hypercube with \(M=2^n\) processors, the processors are numbered 0 to \(M-1\text{.}\) Two processors are connected if their binary representations differ in exactly one bit. The hypercube has proven to be the best possible network for certain problems requiring the use of a “supercomputer.”</p>
