<li><p>If \(n \geq  2\text{,}\) \(\mathbb{Z}_2{}^n\) , the direct product of \(n\) factors of \(\mathbb{Z}_2\text{,}\) is a group with \(2^n\) elements. We will take a closer look at \(\mathbb{Z}_2{}^3 = \mathbb{Z}_2 \times  \mathbb{Z}_2 \times  \mathbb{Z}_2\text{.}\) The elements of this group are triples of zeros and ones. Since the operation on \(\mathbb{Z}_2\) is \(+_2\text{,}\) we will use the symbol + for the operation on \(\mathbb{Z}_2{}^3\) . Two of the eight triples in the group are \(a = (1, 0, 1)\) and \(b = (0, 0, 1)\text{.}\) Their “sum” is \(a + b = \left(1 +_2 0, 0 +_2 0, 1 +_2 1\right)
= (1, 0, 0)\text{.}\) One interesting fact about this group is that each element is its own inverse. For example \(a + a = (1, 0, 1) + (1, 0, 1) = (0, 0,
0)\text{;}\) therefore \(-a = a\text{.}\) We use the additive notation for the inverse of \(a\) because we are using a form of addition. Note that \(\{(0, 0, 0), (1,
0, 1)\}\) is a subgroup of \(\mathbb{Z}_2{}^3\text{.}\) Write out the “addition” table for this set and apply <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/th-subgroup-of-finite-group.html" title="Theorem 11.5.5: Condition for a Subgroup of Finite Group">Theorem 11.5.5</a>. The same can be said for any set consisting of (0, 0, 0) and another element of \(\mathbb{Z}_2{}^3\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li>
<p>The direct product of the positive real numbers with the integers modulo 4, \(\mathbb{R}^+ \times  \mathbb{Z}_4\) is an infinite group since one of its factors is infinite. The operations on the factors are multiplication and modular addition, so we will select the neutral symbol \(\diamond\) for the operation on \(\mathbb{R}^+ \times  \mathbb{Z}_4\text{.}\) If \(a = (4, 3)\) and \(b = (0.5, 2)\text{,}\) then</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{c}
a \diamond  b = (4, 3) \diamond  (0.5, 2) = \left(4 \cdot  0.5, 3 +_4 2\right) = (2, 1)\\
b^2 = b \diamond  b = (0.5, 2) \diamond  (0.5, 2) = (0.25, 0)\\
a^{-1} = \left(4^{-1} , -3\right) = (0.25, 1)\\
b^{-1} = \left(0.5^{-1} , -2\right) = (2, 2)
\end{array}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>It would be incorrect to say that \(\mathbb{Z}_4\) is a subgroup of \(\mathbb{R}^+\times  \mathbb{Z}_4\) , but there is a subgroup of the direct product that closely resembles \(\mathbb{Z}_4\text{.}\) It is \(\{(1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3)\}\text{.}\) Its table is</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{c|cccc}
\diamond &amp;(1, 0)&amp; (1, 1)&amp; (1, 2)&amp; (1, 3)\\
\hline
(1, 0)&amp;(1, 0)&amp; (1, 1)&amp; (1, 2)&amp; (1, 3)\\
(1, 1)&amp;(1, 1)&amp; (1, 2)&amp; (1, 3)&amp; (1, 0)\\
(1, 2)&amp;(1, 2)&amp; (1, 3)&amp; (1, 0)&amp; (1, 1)\\
(1, 3)&amp;(1, 3)&amp; (1, 0)&amp; (1, 1)&amp; (1, 2)\\
\end{array}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Imagine erasing \((1, )\) throughout the table and writing \(+_4\) in place of \(\diamond\text{.}\) What would you get? We will explore this phenomenon in detail in the next section.</p>
<p>The whole direct product could be visualized as four parallel half-lines labeled 0, 1, 2, and 3 as in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-four-line-group.html" title="Figure 11.6.7">Figure 11.6.7</a>. On the \(k\)th line, the point that lies \(x\) units to the right of the zero mark would be \((x,k)\text{.}\) The set \(\{(2^n, (n)1) \mid n \in \mathbb{Z}\}\text{,}\) which is depicted on the figure is a subgroup of \(\mathbb{R}^+\times  \mathbb{Z}_4\text{.}\) What cyclic subgroup is it?</p>
<p>The answer: \(\langle (2, 1)\rangle\) or \(\langle(1/2, 3)\rangle\text{.}\)  There are two different generators.</p>
