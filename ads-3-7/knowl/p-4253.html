<p>System 2: Strings of five bits of computer memory with an OR gate. Individual bit values are either zero or one, so the elements of this system can be visualized as sequences of five 0's and 1's. An OR gate, <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-set-isomorphism.html" title="Figure 11.7.5">FigureÂ 11.7.5</a>, is a small piece of computer hardware that accepts two bit values at any one time and outputs either a zero or one, depending on the inputs. The output of an OR gate is one, except when the two bit values that it accepts are both zero, in which case the output is zero. The operation on this system actually consists of sequentially inputting the values of two bit strings into the OR gate. The result will be a new string of five 0's and 1's. An alternate method of operating in this system is to use five OR gates and to input corresponding pairs of bits from the input strings into the gates concurrently.</p>
