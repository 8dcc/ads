<p>A convenient way to visualize an algebraic expression is by its expression tree. Consider the expression</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
X = a*b - c/d + e.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Since it is customary to put a precedence on multiplication/divisions, \(X\) is evaluated as \(((a*b) -(c/d)) + e\text{.}\) Consecutive multiplication/divisions or addition/subtractions are evaluated from left to right. We can analyze \(X\) further by noting that it is the sum of two simpler expressions \((a*b) - (c/d)\) and \(e\text{.}\) The first of these expressions can be broken down further into the difference of the expressions \(a*b\) and \(c/d\text{.}\) When we decompose any expression into \((\textrm{left expression})\textrm{operation} (\textrm{right expression})\text{,}\) the expression tree of that expression is the binary tree whose root contains the operation and whose left and right subtrees are the trees of the left and right expressions, respectively. Additionally, a simple variable or a number has an expression tree that is a single vertex containing the variable or number. The evolution of the expression tree for expression \(X\) appears in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-expression-tree-build.html" title="Figure 10.4.10">FigureÂ 10.4.10</a>.</p>
