</h6>
<p>The Maximum Flow Problem is derived from the objective of moving the maximum amount of water or other material from the source to the sink. To measure this amount, we define a flow as a function \(f: E \to \mathbb{R}\) such that (1) the flow of material through any edge is nonnegative and no larger than its capacity: \(0 \leq  f(e) \leq  w(e)\text{,}\) for all \(e\in  E\text{;}\) and (2) for each vertex other than the source and sink, the total amount of material that is directed into a vertex is equal to the total amount that is directed out:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align}
\begin{array}{ccc}
\sum_{(x,v)\in E} f(x,v)  &amp; = &amp; \sum_{(v,y)\in E} f(v,y) \\
\textrm{Flow into } v &amp; = &amp; \textrm{ Flow out of } v \\
\end{array}\tag{9.5.1}
\end{align}
</div>
<p>The summation on the left of <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/flow-rules.html" title="Equation 9.5.1">(9.5.1)</a> represents the sum of the flows through each edge in \(E\) that has \(v\) as a terminal vertex. The right-hand side indicates that you should add all of the flows through edges that initiate at \(v\text{.}\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s-graph-optimization.html#problem-maximal-flow">in-context</a></span>
