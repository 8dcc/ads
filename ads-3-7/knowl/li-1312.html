<p>How to compute the terms of \(B\) is not so clear. Suppose that you wanted to know \(B(100)\text{.}\) One approach would be to apply the definition recursively:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
B(100) = B(99) + 3 = (B(98) + 3) + 3 =\cdots
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>The recursion equation for \(B\) would be applied 100 times and 100 additions would then follow. To compute \(B(k)\) by this method, \(2k\) operations are needed. An iterative computation of \(B(k)\) is an improvement: \(B(1) =B(0) +3 = 2 + 3 = 5\\
\\
B(2) =B(1)+3= 5 + 3 = 8\\
\\
\text{etc}.\) Only \(k\) additions are needed. This still isn't a good situation. As \(k\) gets large, we take more and more time to compute \(B(k)\text{.}\)  The formula \(B(k)=B(k-1)+3\) is called a recurrence relation on \(B\text{.}\) The process of finding a closed form expression for \(B(k)\text{,}\) one that requires no more than some fixed number of operations, is called solving the recurrence relation.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s-Sequences.html#li-1312">in-context</a></span>
