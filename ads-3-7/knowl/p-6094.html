<p>By the last condition  \(\sqrt{2}\) must be an element of \(S\text{,}\) and, if \(S\) is to be a field, the sum, product, difference, and quotient of elements in \(S\) must be in \(S\text{.}\) So operations involving this number, such as  \(\sqrt{2}\text{,}\) \(\left(\sqrt{2}\right)^2\text{,}\) \(\left(\sqrt{2}\right)^3\text{,}\) \(\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{2}\text{,}\) \(\sqrt{2}-\sqrt{2}\text{,}\) and \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\)  must all be elements of \(S\text{.}\)   Further, since \(S\) contains \(\mathbb{Q}\) as a subset, any element of \(\mathbb{Q}\) combined with \(\sqrt{2}\) under any field operation must be an element of \(S\text{.}\) Hence, every element of the form \(a + b \sqrt{2}\text{,}\) where \(a\) and \(b\) can be any elements in \(\mathbb{Q}\text{,}\) is an element of \(S\text{.}\) We leave to the reader to show that \(S =\{a + b \sqrt{2} \mid a, b \in \mathbb{Q}\}\) is a field (see Exercise 1 of this section). We note that the second zero of \(x^2 - 2\text{,}\) namely  \(-\sqrt{2}\text{,}\) is an element of this set. To see this, simply take \(a = 0\) and \(b = -1\text{.}\) The field \(S\) is frequently denoted as \(\mathbb{Q}\left(\sqrt{2}\right)\text{,}\) and it is referred to as an extension field of \(\mathbb{Q}\text{.}\)  Note that the polynomial \(x^2-2=\left(x-\sqrt{2}\right)\left(x+\sqrt{2}\right)\) factors into linear factors, or <dfn class="terminology">splits</dfn>, in \(\mathbb{Q}\left(\sqrt{2}\right)[x]\text{;}\) that is, all coefficients of both factors are elements of the field \(\mathbb{Q}\left(\sqrt{2}\right)\text{.}\)</p>
