<p>You might think that counting something two ways is a waste of time but solving a problem two different ways often is instructive and leads to valuable insights. In this case, it suggests a general formula for the sum \(\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k}\text{.}\) In the case of \(n = 5\text{,}\) we get \(2^5\) so it is reasonable to expect that the general sum is \(2^n\text{,}\) and it is.  A logical argument to prove the general statment simply involves generalizing the previous example to \(n\) coin flips.</p>
