<p>Addition in \(G\) can be done in parallel so that each new subtotal in the form of the triple \((s_1,s_2, s_3)\)  takes only as long to compute as it takes to add in the largest modulus, \(\log _232=5\) time units, if calculations are done in parallel. By the time rule that we have established, the addition of 20 numbers can be done in \(20\cdot 5= 100\) time units, as opposed to \(20\cdot 15 =300\) time units if we do the calculations in \(\mathbb{Z}_{21600}\text{.}\)  However the result is a triple in \(G\text{.}\)  The function that performs the inverse of <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">theta</code> is built into most mathematics programs, including Sage.  In Sage the function is <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">crt</code>.  We use this function to compute the inverse of our triple, which is an element of \(\mathbb{Z}_{21600}\text{.}\)   The result isn't the true sum because the modulus 21600 is not large enough.  However, we verify that our result is congruent to the true sum modulo 21600.</p>
