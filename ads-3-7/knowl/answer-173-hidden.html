<li><p>Not graphic - if the degree of a graph with seven vertices is 6, it is connected to all other vertices and so there cannot be a vertex with degree zero.</p></li>
<li><p>Graphic.  One graph with this degree sequence is a cycle of length 6.</p></li>
<li><p>Not Graphic. The number of vertices with odd degree is odd, which is impossible.</p></li>
<li><p>Graphic.  A "wheel graph" with one vertex connected to all other and the others connected to one another in a cycle has this degree sequence.</p></li>
<li><p>Graphic.  Pairs of vertices connected only to one another.</p></li>
<li><p>Not Graphic.  With two vertices having maximal degree, 5, every vertex would need to have a degree of 2 or more, so the 1 in this sequence makes it non-graphic.</p></li>
