<p>A network of computers can be described easily using a graph.  <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-undirected-1.html" title="Figure 9.1.10">Figure 9.1.10</a> describes a network of five computers, \(a\text{,}\) \(b\text{,}\) \(c\text{,}\) \(d\text{,}\) and \(e\text{.}\) An edge between any two vertices indicates that direct two-way communication is possible between the two computers. Note that the edges of this graph are not directed. This is due to the fact that the relation that is being displayed is symmetric (i.e., if \(X\) can communicate with \(Y\text{,}\) then \(Y\) can communicate with \(X\)). Although directed edges could be used here, it would simply clutter the graph.</p>

<p>This undirected graph, in set terms,  is \(V = \{a, b, c, d, e\}\) and \(E = \{\{a, b\}, \{a, d\}, \{b, c\}, \{b, d\}, \{c, e\}, \{b, e\}\}\)</p>
<p>There are several other situations for which this graph can serve as a model. One of them is to interpret the vertices as cities and the edges as roads, an abstraction of a map such as the one in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-undirected-2.html" title="Figure 9.1.11">Figure 9.1.11</a> . Another interpretation is as an abstraction of the floor plan of a house.  See <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/exercise-house-9-1.html" title="Exercise 9.1.5.11">Exercise 9.1.5.11</a>. Vertex \(a\) represents the outside of the house; all others represent rooms. Two vertices are connected if there is a door between them.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s-graphs-introduction.html#ex-undirected-1">in-context</a></span>
