<p>Out of necessity, integer addition with a computer is addition modulo \(n\text{,}\) for \(n\) some larger number. Consider the case where \(n\) is small, like 64. Then addition involves the addition of six-digit binary numbers. Consider the process of adding 31 and 1. Assume the computer's adder takes as input two bit strings  \(a = \left\{a_0,a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_5\right\}\) and \(b=\left\{b_0,b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4,b_5\right\}\) and outputs \(s = \left\{s_0,s_1,s_2,s_3,s_4,s_5\right\}\text{,}\) the sum of \(a\) and \(b\text{.}\) Then, if \(a = 31 = (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0)\) and \(b = 1 = (1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)\text{,}\) \(s\) will be (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1), or 32. The output \(s_{ }=1\) cannot be determined until all other outputs have been determined. If addition is done with a finite-state machine, as in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ex-binary-adder.html" title="Example 14.3.9: A Binary Adder">ExampleÂ 14.3.9</a>, the time required to get \(s\) will be six time units, where one time unit is the time it takes to get one output from the machine.  In general, the time required to obtain \(s\) will be proportional to the number of bits.   Theoretically, this time can be decreased, but the explanation would require a long digression and our relative results would not change that much. We will use the rule that the number of time units needed to perform addition modulo \(n\) is proportional to  \(\left\lceil \log_2n\right\rceil\text{.}\)</p>
