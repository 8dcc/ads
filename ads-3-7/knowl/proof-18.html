<p>(Indirect): Suppose \(u\) is connected to \(w\text{,}\) but the shortest path from \(u\) to \(w\) has length \(m\text{,}\) where \(m&gt;n\text{.}\) A vertex list for a path of length \(m\) will have \(m + 1\) vertices. This path can be represented as \(\left(v_0,v_1,\ldots, v_m\right)\text{,}\) where \(v_0=u\) and \(v_m= w\text{.}\) Note that since there are only \(n\) vertices in the graph and \(m\) vertices are listed in the path after \(v_0\text{,}\) we can apply the pigeonhole principle and be assured that there must be some duplication in the last \(m\) vertices of the vertex list, which represents a circuit in the path. This means that our path of minimum length can be reduced, which is a contradiction.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s-Connectivity.html#proof-18">in-context</a></span>
