<p>\(\mathbb{Z}_{12} = [\mathbb{Z}_{12}; +_{12} ]\text{,}\)  where \(+_{12}\) is addition modulo 12, is a cyclic group. To verify this statement, all we need to do is demonstrate that some element of \(\mathbb{Z}_{12}\)  is a generator. One such element is 5; that is, \(\langle 5 \rangle = \mathbb{Z}_{12}\text{.}\) One more obvious generator is 1. In fact, 1 is a generator of every \([\mathbb{Z}_n; +_n]\text{.}\) The reader is asked to prove that if an element is a generator, then its inverse is also a generator. Thus, \(-5 = 7\) and \(-1 = 11\) are the other generators of \(\mathbb{Z}_{12}\text{.}\) The remaining eight elements of the group are not generators.</p>
