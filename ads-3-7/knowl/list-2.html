<div class="introduction"><p>Assume that we have a graph with \(n\) vertices that can be indexed by the integers \(1, 2, \dots, n\text{.}\)  Here are three different data structures that can be employed to represent graphs.</p></div>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Adjacency Matrix:  As we saw in Chapter 6, the information about edges in a graph can be summarized with an adjacency matrix, \(G\text{,}\) where \(G_{ij}=1\) if and only if vertex \(i\) is connected to vertex \(j\) in the graph.  Note that this is the same as the adjacency matrix for a relation.</p></li>
<li><p>Edge Dictionary:  For each vertex in our graph, we maintain a list of edges that initiate at that vertex. If \(G\) represents the graph's edge information, then we denote by \(G_i\) the list of vertices that are terminal vertices  of edges initiating at vertex \(i\text{.}\) The exact syntax that would be used can vary.  We will use Sage/Python syntax in our examples.</p></li>
<li><p>Edge List:  Note that in creating either of the first two data structures, we would presume that a list of edges for the graph exists. A simple way to represent the edges is to maintain this list of ordered pairs, or two element sets, depending on whether the graph is intended to be directed or undirected.  We will not work with this data structure here, other than in the first example.</p></li>
