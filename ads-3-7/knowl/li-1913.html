<p>If \(n \geq  2\text{,}\) \(\mathbb{Z}_2{}^n\) , the direct product of \(n\) factors of \(\mathbb{Z}_2\text{,}\) is a group with \(2^n\) elements. We will take a closer look at \(\mathbb{Z}_2{}^3 = \mathbb{Z}_2 \times  \mathbb{Z}_2 \times  \mathbb{Z}_2\text{.}\) The elements of this group are triples of zeros and ones. Since the operation on \(\mathbb{Z}_2\) is \(+_2\text{,}\) we will use the symbol + for the operation on \(\mathbb{Z}_2{}^3\) . Two of the eight triples in the group are \(a = (1, 0, 1)\) and \(b = (0, 0, 1)\text{.}\) Their “sum” is \(a + b = \left(1 +_2 0, 0 +_2 0, 1 +_2 1\right)
= (1, 0, 0)\text{.}\) One interesting fact about this group is that each element is its own inverse. For example \(a + a = (1, 0, 1) + (1, 0, 1) = (0, 0,
0)\text{;}\) therefore \(-a = a\text{.}\) We use the additive notation for the inverse of \(a\) because we are using a form of addition. Note that \(\{(0, 0, 0), (1,
0, 1)\}\) is a subgroup of \(\mathbb{Z}_2{}^3\text{.}\) Write out the “addition” table for this set and apply <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/th-subgroup-of-finite-group.html" title="Theorem 11.5.5: Condition for a Subgroup of Finite Group">Theorem 11.5.5</a>. The same can be said for any set consisting of (0, 0, 0) and another element of \(\mathbb{Z}_2{}^3\text{.}\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s-direct-products.html#li-1913">in-context</a></span>
