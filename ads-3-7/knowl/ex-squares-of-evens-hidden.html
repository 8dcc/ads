<body><article class="example example-like"><p>Let \(n \in  \mathbb{Z}\text{.}\) We will outline a proof that \(n^2\) is even if and only if \(n\) is even.</p>
<p>Outline of a proof: Since this is an “If and only if” theorem we must prove two things:</p>
<ol class="lower-roman">
<li><p>(\(\Rightarrow \)) If \(n^2\) is even, then \(n\) is even. To do this directly, assume that \(n^{2 }\) is even and prove that \(n\) is even.   To do this indirectly, assume \(n^2\) is even and that \(n\) is odd, and reach a contradiction.   It turns out that the latter of the two approaches is easiest here.</p></li>
<li><p>(\(\Leftarrow \)) If \(n\) is even, then \(n^2\) is even. To do this directly, assume that \(n\) is even and prove that \(n^2\) is even.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Now that we have broken the theorem down into two parts and know what to prove, we proceed to prove the two implications. The final ingredient that we need is a convenient way of describing even integers. When we refer to an integer \(n\) (or \(m\text{,}\) or \(k\text{,.}\) . . ) as even, we can always replace it with a product of the form \(2q\text{,}\) where \(q\) is an integer (more precisely, \(\left.(\exists q) _{\mathbb{Z}} (n = 2q)\right)\text{.}\) In other words, for an integer to be even it must have a factor of two in its prime decomposition.</p></article></body>
