<p>If \(x\) and \(y\) are two vertices of a graph, then a <dfn class="terminology">path</dfn> between \(x\) and \(y\) describes a motion from \(x\) and \(y\) along edges of the graph. Vertex \(x\) is called the initial vertex of the path and \(y\) is called the terminal vertex. A path between \(x\) and \(y\) can always be described by its  edge list, the list of edges that were used: \(\left(e_1, e_2,
\ldots , e_n\right)\text{,}\) where: (1) the initial vertex of \(e_1\) is \(x\text{;}\) (2) the terminal vertex of \(e_i\) is the initial vertex of \(e_{i+1}\text{,}\) \(i = 1, 2, \ldots , n - 1\text{;}\) and (3) the terminal vertex of \(e_n\) is \(y\text{.}\) The number of edges in the edge list is the <dfn class="terminology">path length</dfn>. A path on a simple graph can also be described by a vertex list. A path of length \(n\) will have a list of \(n + 1\) vertices \(v_0=x\text{,}\) \(v_1\text{,}\) \(v_2,\ldots ,v_n=y\text{,}\) where, for \(k = 0,1,2,\ldots , n-1\text{,}\) \(\left(v_k,v_{k+1}\right)\) is an edge on the graph. A <dfn class="terminology">circuit</dfn> is a path that terminates at its initial vertex.</p>
