<p>Phase 2. As we enter this phase, we have constructed a path that uses a proper subset of the edges in our graph. We will refer to this path as the current path. Let \(V\) be the vertices of our graph, \(E\) the edges, and \(E_u\) the edges that have been used in the current path. Consider the graph \(G' = \left(V, E - E_u\right)\text{.}\)  Note that every vertex in \(G'\) has an even degree. Select any edge, \(e\text{,}\) from \(G'.\) Let \(v_a\) and \(v_b\) be the vertices that \(e\) connects. Trace a new path starting at \(v_a\) whose first edge is \(e\text{.}\) We can be sure that at least one vertex of the new path is also in the current path since \((V, E)\) is connected. Starting at \(v_a\text{,}\) there exists a path in \((V, E)\) to any vertex in the current path. At some point along this path, which we can consider the start of the new path, we will have intersected the current path. Since the degree of each vertex in \(G'\) is even, any path that we start at \(v_a\) can be continued until it is a circuit. Now, we simply augment the current path with this circuit. As we travel along the current path, the first time that we intersect the new path, we travel along it (see <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-path-augmentation.html" title="Figure 9.4.8">FigureÂ 9.4.8</a>). Once we complete the circuit that is the new path, we resume the traversal of the current path.</p>
