<li><p>The Minimum Spanning Tree Problem: Given a weighted graph, \((V, E, w)\text{,}\) find a subset \(E'\) of \(E\) with the properties that \((V, E')\) is connected and the sum of the weights of edges in \(E'\) is as small as possible. We will discuss this problem in Chapter 10.</p></li>
<li><p>The Minimum Matching Problem: Given an undirected weighted graph, \((K, E, w)\text{,}\) with an even number of vertices, pair up the vertices so that each pair is connected by an edge and the sum of these edges is as small as possible. A unit square version of this problem has been studied extensively. See <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/biblio-sopowit-1983.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 38: The Traveling Salesman Problem and Minimum Matching in the Unit Square">[38]</a> for details on what is known about this version of the problem.</p></li>
<li><p>  The Graph Center Problem: Given a connected, undirected, weighted graph, find a vertex (called a center) in the graph with the property that the distance from the center to every other vertex is as small as possible. “As small as possible” is  normally interpreted  as minimizing the maximum distance from the center to a vertex.</p></li>
