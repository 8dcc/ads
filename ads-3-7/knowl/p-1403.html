<p><em class="emphasis">Tips on Reading Multiply-Quantified Propositions.</em> It is understandable that you would find propositions such as \(x\) difficult to read. The trick to deciphering these expressions is to “peel” one quantifier off the proposition just as you would peel off the layers of an onion (but quantifiers shouldn't make you cry!). Since the outermost quantifier in \(x\) is universal, \(x\) says that \(z(a) : (\exists  b)_{\mathbb{R}^+}(a b = 1)\) is true for each value that \(a\) can take on. Now take the time to select a value for \(a\text{,}\) like 6. For the value that we selected, we get \(z(6) : (\exists b)_{\mathbb{R}^+}(6b = 1)\text{,}\) which is obviously true since \(6b = 1\) has a solution in the positive real numbers. We will get that same truth value no matter which positive real number we choose for \(a\text{;}\) therefore, \(z(a)\) is a tautology over \(\mathbb{R}^+\) and we are justified in saying that \(x\) is true. The key to understanding propositions like \(x\) on your own is to experiment with actual values for the outermost variables as we did above.</p>
