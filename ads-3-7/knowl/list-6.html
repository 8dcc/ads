<li><p>This algorithm will produce one path from vertex \(i\) to vertex \(j\text{,}\) if one exists, and that path will be as short as possible.  If more than one path of this length exists, then the one that is produced depends on the order in which the edges are examined and the order in which the elements of \(D_r\) are examined in Step 4.</p></li>
<li><p>The condition \(D_{r }\neq \emptyset\) is analogous to the condition that no mail is sent in a given stage of the process, in which case MSU cannot be connected to ESU.</p></li>
<li><p>This algorithm can be easily revised to find paths to all vertices that can be reached from vertex \(i\text{.}\) Step 5 would be put off until a specific path to a vertex is needed since the information in \(V\) contains an efficient list of all paths. The algorithm can also be extended further to find paths between any two vertices.</p></li>
