<p>It is important to realize that the properties listed above depend on both the set and the operation(s). Statements such as “Multiplication is commutative.” or “The positive integers are closed.” are meaningless on their own.  Naturally, if we have established a context in which the missing set or operation is clearly implied, then they would have meaning.</p>
