<p>Imagine that you were told that there is a large sum of money behind one of two doors marked A and B, and that one of the two propositions \(x\) and \(y\) is true and the other is false. Which door would you choose? All that you need to realize is that if \(x\) is true, then \(y\) will also be true. Since we know that this can't be the case, \(y\) must be the true proposition and the money is behind Door B.</p>
