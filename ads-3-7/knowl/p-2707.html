<p>Suppose you open a savings account that pays an annual interest rate of \(8\%\text{.}\) In addition, suppose you decide to deposit one dollar when you open the account, and you intend to double your deposit each year. Let \(B(k)\) be your balance after \(k\) years. \(B\) can be described by the relation \(B(k) = 1.08 B(k - 1) + 2^k\text{,}\) with \(S(0) = 1\text{.}\) If, instead of doubling the deposit each year, you deposited a constant amount, \(q\text{,}\) the \(2^k\) term would be replaced with \(q\text{.}\)  A sequence of regular deposits such as this is called a simple annuity.</p>
