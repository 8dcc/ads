<p>Therefore, \(a + 1\) is also a zero of \(x^2 + x + 1\text{.}\) Hence, \(S = \{0, 1, a, a + 1\}\) is the smallest field that contains \(\mathbb{Z}_2 = \{0, 1\}\) as a subfield and contains all zeros of \(x^2 + x + 1\text{.}\) This extension field is denoted by \(\mathbb{Z}_2(a)\text{.}\) Note that \(x^2 + x + 1\) splits in \(\mathbb{Z}_2(a)\text{;}\) that is, it factors into linear factors in \(\mathbb{Z}_2(a)\text{.}\) We also observe that \(\mathbb{Z}_2(a)\) is a field containing exactly four elements. By <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/theorem-number-of-fields.html" title="Theorem 16.2.10">TheoremÂ 16.2.10</a>, we expected that \(\mathbb{Z}_2(a)\) would be of order \(p^2\) for some prime \(p\) and positive integer \(n\text{.}\) Also recall that all fields of order \(p^n\) are isomorphic. Hence, we have described all fields of order \(2^2 =4\) by finding the extension field of a polynomial that is irreducible over \(\mathbb{Z}_2\text{.}\)</p>
