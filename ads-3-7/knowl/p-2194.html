<p>Consider a telephone network in which the main office \(a\) is connected to, and can communicate to, individuals \(b\) and \(c\text{.}\)  Both \(b\) and \(c\) can communicate to another person, \(d\text{;}\) however, the main office cannot communicate with \(d\text{.}\) Assume communication is only one way, as indicated. This situation can be described by the relation \(r = \{(a, b), (a, c), (b, d), (c, d)\}\text{.}\) We would like to change the system so that the main office \(a\) can communicate with person \(d\) and still maintain the previous system. We, of course, want the most economical system.</p>
