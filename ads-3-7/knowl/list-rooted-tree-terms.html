<div class="introduction"><p>What differentiates rooted trees from undirected trees is that a rooted tree contains a distinguished vertex, called the root. Consider the tree in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-rooted-tree-10-3.html" title="Figure 10.3.1">Figure 10.3.1</a>. Vertex \(A\) has been designated the root of the tree. If we choose any other vertex in the tree, such as \(M\text{,}\) we know that there is a unique path from \(A\) to \(M\text{.}\) The vertices on this path, \((A, D, K, M)\text{,}\) are described in genealogical terms:</p></div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>\(M\) is a child of \(K\) (so is \(L\))</p></li>
<li><p>\(K\) is \(M\)'s parent.</p></li>
<li><p>\(A\text{,}\) \(D\text{,}\) and \(K\) are \(M\)'s ancestors.</p></li>
<li><p>\(D\text{,}\) \(K\text{,}\) and \(M\) are descendants of \(A\text{.}\)</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="conclusion">
<p>These genealogical relationships are often easier to visualize if the tree is rewritten so that children are positioned below their parents, as in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-rooted-tree-10-3-redrawn.html" title="Figure 10.3.3">Figure 10.3.3</a>.</p>
<p>With this format, it is easy to see that each vertex in the tree can be thought of as the root of a tree that contains, in addition to itself, all of its descendants. For example, \(D\) is the root of a tree that contains \(D\text{,}\) \(K\text{,}\) \(L\text{,}\) and \(M\text{.}\) Furthermore, \(K\) is the root of a tree that contains \(K\text{,}\) \(L\text{,}\) and \(M\text{.}\) Finally, \(L\) and \(M\) are roots of trees that contain only themselves. From this observation, we can give a formal definition of a rooted tree.</p>
