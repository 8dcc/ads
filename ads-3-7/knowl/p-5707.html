<p>At the receiving end, the decoding function acts on the four-bit block \(b = \left(b_1,b _2 ,b_3,b_4 \right)\) with the function  \(d: \mathbb{Z}_2{}^4\to \mathbb{Z}_2^4\text{,}\) where</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
d(b) = \left(b_1,b _2 ,b_3,b_1+_2b _2 +_2b_3+_2b_4 \right)
\end{equation*}

<p>The fourth bit is called the parity-check bit. If no parity error occurs, the first three bits are recorded as part of the message. If a parity error occurs, we will assume that a retransmission of that block can be requested. This request can take the form of automatically having the parity-check bit of \(d(b)\) sent back to the source. If 1 is received, the previous block is retransmitted; if 0 is received, the next block is sent. This assumption of two-way communication is significant, but it is desirable to make this coding system useful. It is reasonable to expect that the probability of a transmission error in the opposite direction is also 0.001.  Without going into the details, we will report that the probability of success is approximately 0.990 and the rate is approximately 3/5. The rate includes the transmission of the parity-check bit to the source.</p>
