<p>Suppose that \(C\) is a small positive number. Consider the recurrence relation \(B(k) - 2B(k - 1) + \left(1 - C ^2\right)B(k - 2)
= C^2\text{,}\) with initial conditions \(B(0) = 1\) and \(B(1) = 1\text{.}\) If \(C\) is small enough, we might consider approximating the relation by replacing \(1 - C^2\) with 1 and \(C^2\) with 0. Solve the original relation and its approximation. Let \(B_a\) a be the solution of the approximation. Compare closed form expressions for \(B(k)\) and \(B_a(k)\text{.}\) Their forms are very different because the characteristic roots of the original relation were close together and the approximation resulted in one double characteristic root.If characteristic roots of a relation are relatively far apart, this problem will not occur. For example, compare the general solutions of \(S(k) + 1.001S(k - 1) - 2.004002 S(k - 2) = 0.0001\) and \(S_a(k) + S_a(k - 1) - 2S_a(k - 2) = 0\text{.}\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s-recurrence-relations.html#exercise-335">in-context</a></span>
