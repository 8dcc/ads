<p>Intuitively, you could probably predict what the term “subgraph” means.  A graph contained within a graph, right?  But since a graph involves two sets, vertices and edges, does it involve a subset of both of these sets, or just one of them?   The answer is it could be either.  There are different types of subgraphs. The two that we will define below will meet most of our future needs in discussing the theory of graphs.</p>
