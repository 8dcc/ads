<p>What happens if you start at one of the unused tacks and again jump to every third tack? The two broken paths on <a data-knowl="./knowl/fig-string-art-cosets.html" title="Figure 15.2.1">FigureÂ 15.2.1</a> show that identical squares are produced. The tacks are thus partitioned into very similar subsets. The subsets of \(\mathbb{Z}_{12}\) that they correspond to are \(\{0,
3, 6, 9\}\text{,}\) \(\{1, 4, 7, 10\}\text{,}\) and \(\{2, 5, 8, 11\}\text{.}\) These subsets are called cosets. In particular, they are called cosets of the subgroup \(\{0, 3, 6, 9\}\text{.}\) We will see that under certain conditions, cosets of a subgroup can form a group of their own. Before pursuing this example any further we will examine the general situation.</p>
