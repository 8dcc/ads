<p>Next we turn to the method of correcting errors. Despite the fact that there are only eight code words, one for each three-bit block value, the set of possible received blocks is \(\mathbb{Z}_2{}^6\text{,}\) with 64 elements. Suppose that \(b\) is not a code word, but that it differs from a code word by exactly one bit. In other words, it is the result of a single error in transmission. Suppose that \(w\) is the code word that \(b\) is closest to and that they differ in the first bit. Then \(b + w = (1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)\) and</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
p(b) &amp; = p(b) + p(w)\quad \textrm{  since }p(w) = (0, 0, 0)\\
&amp;=p(b+w)\quad\textrm{ since }p \textrm{ is a homomorphism}\\
&amp; =p(1,0,0,0,0,0)\\
&amp; =(1,1,0)\\
\end{split}
