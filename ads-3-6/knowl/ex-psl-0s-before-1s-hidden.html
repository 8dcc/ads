<body><article class="example-like"><p>We can define the set of all strings over \(B\) for which all 0's precede all 1's as follows. Define the starting symbol \(S\) and establish rules that \(S\) can be replaced with any of the following: \(\lambda\text{,}\) \(0S\text{,}\) or \(S1\text{.}\) These replacement rules are usually called production rules.  They are usually written in the format \(S\to \lambda\text{,}\) \(S\to 0S\text{,}\) and \(S\to S1\text{.}\) Now define \(L\) to be the set of all strings that can be produced by starting with \(S\) and applying the production rules until \(S\) no longer appears. The strings in \(L\) are exactly the ones that are described above.</p></article></body>
