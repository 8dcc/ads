<span class="type">Example</span> <span class="codenumber">12.1.8</span>. <span class="title">A system with an infinite number of solutions.</span>
</h6>
<p>Next, let's attempt to find all of the solutions to:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{l}
\text{   }x_1+6 x_2+2 x_3=1 \\
2 x_1\text{   }+x_2+3 x_3 =2 \\
4 x_1+2 x_2+6 x_3=4 \\
\end{array}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>The augmented matrix for the system is</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align}
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc|c}
1 &amp; 6 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 \\
2 &amp; 1 &amp; 3 &amp; 2 \\
4 &amp; 2 &amp; 6 &amp; 4 \\
\end{array}
\right)\tag{12.1.8}
\end{align}
</div>
<p>which reduces to</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align}
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc|c}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; \frac{16}{11} &amp; 1 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; \frac{1}{11} &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
\end{array}
\right)\tag{12.1.9}
\end{align}
</div>
<p>If we apply additional elementary row operations to this matrix, it will only become more complicated. In particular, we cannot get a one in the third row, third column. Since the matrix is in simplest form, we will express it in equation format to help us determine the solution set.</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{gather}
\begin{array}{l}
x_1 \quad+\frac{16}{11} x_3 =1 \\
\quad x_2+\frac{1}{11}x_3 =0\\
\quad\quad\quad \quad 0=0 \\
\end{array}\tag{12.1.10}
\end{gather}
</div>
<p>Any real numbers will satisfy the last equation. However, the first equation can be rewritten as \(x_1 =1-\frac{16 }{11}x_3\text{,}\) which describes the coordinate \(x_1\) in terms of \(x_3\) . Similarly, the second equation gives \(x_2\) in terms of \(x_3\) . A convenient way of listing the solutions of this system is to use set notation. If we call the solution set of the system \(S\text{,}\) then</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
S = \left\{\left(1-\frac{16}{11}x_3, -\frac{1}{11}x_3, x_3\right) \mid x_3\in \mathbb{R}\right\}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>What this means is that if we wanted to list all solutions, we would replace \(x_3\) by all possible numbers. Clearly, there is an infinite number of solutions, two of which are \((1, 0, 0)\) and \((-15, -1, 11)\text{,}\) when \(x_3\) takes on the values 0 and 11, respectively.</p>
<p>A Word Of Caution: Frequently we may can get “different-looking” answers to the same problem when a system has an infinite number of solutions. Assume the solutions set in this example is reported to be \(A = \left\{\left(1+16x_2, x_2, -11x_3\right) \mid x_3\in \mathbb{R}\right\}\text{.}\) Certainly the result described by \(S\) looks different from that described by \(A\text{.}\) To see whether they indeed describe the same set, we wish to determine whether every solution produced in \(S\) can be generated in \(A\text{.}\) For example, the solution generated by \(S\) when \(x_3=11\) is \((-15, -1, 11)\text{.}\) The same triple can be produced by \(A\) by taking \(x_2= -1\text{.}\) We must prove that every solution described in \(S\) is described in \(A\) and, conversely, that every solution described in \(A\) is described in \(S\text{.}\) (See Exercise 6 of this section.)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s-systems-linear-equations.html#ex-system-infinite-solutions">in-context</a></span>
