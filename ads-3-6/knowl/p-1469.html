<p>The initial response of most people when confronted with the task of being told they must be able to read and do proofs is often “Why?” or “I can't do proofs.” To answer the first question, doing proofs or problem solving, even on the most trivial level, involves being able to read statements. First we must understand the problem and know the hypothesis; second, we must realize when we are done and we must understand the conclusion. To apply theorems or algorithms we must be able to read theorems and their proofs intelligently.</p>
