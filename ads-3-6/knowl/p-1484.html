<p>Our final example will be an outline of the proof that the square root of 2 is irrational (not an element of \(\mathbb{Q}\)). This is an example of the theorem that does not appear to be in the standard \(P \Rightarrow  C\) form. One way to rephrase the theorem is: If \(x\) is a  rational number, then \(x^2\neq 2\text{.}\) A direct proof of this theorem would require that we verify that the square of every rational number is not equal to 2. There is no convenient way of doing this, so we must turn to the indirect method of proof. In such a proof, we assume that \(x\) is a  rational number and that \(x^2=2\text{.}\) This will lead to a contradiction. In order to reach this contradiction, we need to use the following facts:</p>
