<p>Next, we consider a recursive algorithm for a binary search within a sorted list of items.  Suppose  \(r=\{r(1),r(2), \ldots  , r(n)\}\) represent a list of \(n\) items sorted by a numeric key in descending order. The \(j^{th}\) item is denoted \(r(j)\) and its key value by \(r(j).\texttt{key}\text{.}\) For example, each item might contain data on the buildings in a city and the key value might be the height of the building. Then \(r(1)\) would be the item for the tallest building and  \(r(1).\texttt{key}\) would be its height. The algorithm \(\texttt{BinarySearch}(j, k)\) can be applied to search for an item in \(r\) with key value \(C\text{.}\) This would be accomplished by the execution of \(\texttt{BinarySearch}(1, n)\text{.}\) When the algorithm is completed, the variable \(\texttt{Found}\) will have a value of \(\texttt{true}\) if an item with the desired key value was found, and the value of \(\textrm{location}\) will be the index of an item whose key is \(C\text{.}\) If \(\texttt{Found}\) keeps the value \(\texttt{false}\text{,}\) no such item exists in the list. The general idea behind the algorithm is illustrated in <a data-knowl="./knowl/fig-binsearch.html" title="Figure 8.1.6">FigureÂ 8.1.6</a></p>
