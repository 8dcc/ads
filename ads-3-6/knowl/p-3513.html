<p>In this chapter we will study the class of graphs called trees. Trees are frequently used in both mathematics and the sciences. Our solution of <a data-knowl="./knowl/lunch-possibilies1.html" title="Example 2.1.1: How many lunches can you have?">ExampleÂ 2.1.1</a> is one simple instance. Since they are often used to illustrate or prove other concepts, a poor understanding of trees can be a serious handicap.
