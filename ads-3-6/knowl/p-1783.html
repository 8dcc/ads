<p>In this exercise, we propose to show how matrix multiplication is a natural operation.  Suppose a bakery produces bread, cakes and pies every weekday, Monday through Friday. Based on past sales history, the bakery produces various numbers of each product each day, summarized in the \(5 \times 3\) matrix \(D\text{.}\)  It should be noted that the order could be described as “number of days by number of products.”   For example, on Wednesday (the third day) the number of cakes (second product in our list) that are produced  is  \(d_{3,2} = 4\text{.}\)</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
D =\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
25 &amp; 5 &amp; 5 \\
14 &amp; 5 &amp; 8 \\
20 &amp; 4 &amp; 15 \\
18 &amp; 5 &amp; 7 \\
35 &amp; 10 &amp; 9 \\
\end{array}
\right)
\end{equation*}
