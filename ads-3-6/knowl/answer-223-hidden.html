<p>Assume that \(H\) and \(K\) are subgroups of group \(G\text{,}\) and that, as in <a data-knowl="./knowl/fig-venn-subgroups.html" title="Figure 11.5.12">FigureÂ 11.5.12</a>, there are elements \(x \in  H - K\) and \(y \in  K - H\text{.}\) Consider the product \(x * y\text{.}\) Where could it be placed in the Venn diagram? If we can prove that it must lie in the outer region, \(H^c \cap K^c=(H \cup K)^c\text{,}\) then we have proven that \(H \cup  K\) is not closed under \(*\) and cannot be a subgroup of \(G\text{,}\) Assume that  \(x*y\in H\text{.}\)  Since \(x\) is in  \(H\text{,}\)  \(x^{-1}\) is in \(H\) and so by closure \(x^{-1}*(x * y )= y \in H\) which is a contradiction.   Similarly, \(x*y \notin K\text{.}\)</p>
<p>One way to interpret this theorem is that no group is the union of two groups.</p>
