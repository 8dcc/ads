<body><article class="example-like"><p>One of the keys to working with large amounts of information is to organize it in a consistent, logical way. A <dfn class="terminology">data structure</dfn> is a scheme for organizing data.  A simple example of a data structure might be the information a college admissions department might keep on their applicants.  Items might look something like this:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
ApplicantItem &amp; = (FirstName,MiddleInitial,LastName,StreetAddress,\\
&amp; City,State,Zip,HomePhone,CellPhone,EmailAddress,\\
&amp; HighSchool,Major,ApplicationPaid,MathSAT,VerbalSAT,\\
&amp; Recommendation1,Recommendation2,Recommendation3)
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>This structure is called a “flat file”.</p>
<p>A spreadsheet can be used to arrange  data in this way. Although a “flat file” structure is often adequate, there are advantages to clustering some the information.  For example the applicant information might be broken into four parts: name, contact information, high school, and application data:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
ApplicantItem &amp; = ((FirstName,MiddleInitial, LastName),\\
&amp;((StreetAddress,City,State,Zip),\\
&amp; (HomePhone,CellPhone),EmailAddress),\\
&amp;HighSchool,\\
&amp;(Major,ApplicationPaid,(MathSAT,VerbalSAT),\\
&amp;(Recommendation1,Recommendation2,Recommendation3))
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>The first item in each ApplicantItem is a list \((FirstName, MiddleInitial, LastName)\text{,}\) with each item in that list being a single field of the original flat file. The third item is simply the single high school item from the flat file. The application data is a list and one of its items, is itself a list with the recommendation data for each recommendation the applicant has.</p>
<p>The organization of this data can be visualized with a rooted tree such as the one in <a data-knowl="./knowl/fig-applicant-tree.html" title="Figure 10.3.7">Figure 10.3.7</a>.</p>
<figure class="figure-like"><div style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%;"><img src="images/fig-applicant-tree.png" style="width: 100%; height: auto;" alt="Applicant Data in a Rooted Tree"></div>
<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span> <span class="codenumber">10.3.7.</span> Applicant Data in a Rooted Tree</figcaption></figure><p>In general, you can represent a data item, \(T\text{,}\) as a rooted tree with \(T\) as the root and a subtree for each field. Those fields that are more than just one item are roots of further subtrees, while individual items have no further children in the tree.</p></article></body>
