<p>Commentary: The usual and first approach would be to assume \(A\subseteq B\) and \(B\cap C = \emptyset\) is true and to attempt to prove \(A\cap C = \emptyset\) is true. To do this you would need to show that nothing is contained in the set \(A \cap  C\text{.}\) Think about how you would show that something doesn't exist. It is very difficult to do directly.</p>
