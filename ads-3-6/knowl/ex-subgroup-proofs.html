<li><p>(Concrete) We can verify that \(2\mathbb{Z} \leq  \mathbb{Z}\text{,}\) as stated in <a data-knowl="./knowl/ex-subsystems.html" title="Example 11.5.2: Examples of Subsystems">Example 11.5.2</a>. Whenever you want to discuss a subset, you must find some convenient way of describing its elements. An element of \(2\mathbb{Z}\) can be described as 2 times an integer; that is, \(a \in  2\mathbb{Z}\) is equivalent to \((\exists k)_{\mathbb{Z}}(a = 2k)\text{.}\) Now we can verify that the three conditions of <a data-knowl="./knowl/th-subgroup-conditions.html" title="Theorem 11.5.3: Subgroup Conditions">Theorem 11.5.3</a> are true for 2\(\mathbb{Z}\text{.}\) First, if \(a, b \in  2\mathbb{Z}\text{,}\) then there exist \(j, k \in  \mathbb{Z}\) such that \(a = 2j\) and \(b = 2k\text{.}\)   A common error is to write something like  \(a=2j\)  and \(b=2j\text{.}\)  This would mean that \(a=b\text{,}\) which is not necessarily true.   That is why two different variables are needed to describe \(a\) and \(b\text{.}\)  Returning to our proof, we can add \(a\) and \(b\text{:}\) \(a + b = 2j + 2k = 2(j + k)\text{.}\) Since \(j + k\) is an integer, \(a + b\) is an element of \(2\mathbb{Z}\text{.}\)   Second, the identity, \(0\text{,}\) belongs to 2\(\mathbb{Z}\) (\(0 = 2(0)\)).  Finally, if \(a \in  2\mathbb{Z}\) and \(a = 2k, -a = -(2k) = 2(-k)\text{,}\) and  \(-k\in \mathbb{Z}\text{,}\)  therefore, \(-a \in  2\mathbb{Z}\text{.}\) By <a data-knowl="./knowl/th-subgroup-conditions.html" title="Theorem 11.5.3: Subgroup Conditions">Theorem 11.5.3</a>, \(2\mathbb{Z} \leq  \mathbb{Z}\text{.}\) How would this argument change if you were asked to prove that \(3\mathbb{Z} \leq  \mathbb{Z}\text{?}\) or \(n \mathbb{Z} \leq  \mathbb{Z}, n \geq  2\text{?}\)</p></li>
<li><p>(Concrete) We can prove that \(H = \{0, 3, 6, 9\}\) is a subgroup of \(\mathbb{Z}_{12}\text{.}\) First, for each ordered pair \((a, b) \in  H \times
H\text{,}\) \(a +_{12} b\) is in \(H\text{.}\) This can be checked without too much trouble since \(\left| H \times H\right| = 16\text{.}\) Thus we can conclude that \(H\) is closed under \(+_{12}\text{.}\) Second, \(0\in H\text{.}\) Third, \(-0 = 0\text{,}\) \(-3 = 9\text{,}\) \(-6 = 6\text{,}\) and \(-9 = 3\text{.}\) Therefore, the inverse of each element of \(H\) is in \(H\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>(Axiomatic) If \(H\) and \(K\) are both subgroups of a group \(G\text{,}\) then \(H \cap  K\) is a subgroup of \(G\text{.}\) To justify this statement, we have no concrete information to work with, only the facts that \(H \leq  G\) and \(K \leq G\text{.}\) Our proof that \(H \cap  K \leq  G\) reflects this and is an exercise in applying the definitions of intersection and subgroup, (i) If \(a\) and \(b\) are elements of \(H \cap K\text{,}\) then \(a\) and \(b\) both belong to \(H\text{,}\) and since \(H \leq  G\text{,}\) \(a * b\) must be an element of \(H\text{.}\) Similarly, \(a * b \in  K\text{;}\) therefore, \(a * b \in  H \cap  K\text{.}\) (ii) The identity of \(G\) must belong to both \(H\) and \(K\text{;}\) hence it belongs to \(H \cap  K\text{.}\) (iii) If \(a \in H \cap K\text{,}\) then \(a \in 
H\text{,}\) and since \(H \leq  G\text{,}\) \(a^{-1}\in  H\text{.}\)  Similarly, \(a^{-1}\in K\text{.}\) Hence, by the theorem,  \(H \cap  K \leq  G\text{.}\) Now that this fact has been established, we can apply it to any pair of subgroups of any group. For example, since \(2\mathbb{Z}\) and \(3\mathbb{Z}\) are both subgroups of \([\mathbb{Z};+]\text{,}\) \(2\mathbb{Z} \cap  3\mathbb{Z}\) is also a subgroup of \(\mathbb{Z}\text{.}\) Note that if \(a \in 2\mathbb{Z}
\cap  3\mathbb{Z}\text{,}\)  \(a\) must have a factor of 3; that is, there exists \(k\in \mathbb{Z}\) such that \(a = 3k\text{.}\) In addition, \(a\) must be even, therefore \(k\) must be even. There exists \(j \in  \mathbb{Z}\) such that \(k = 2j\text{,}\) therefore \(a = 3(2j)= 6j\text{.}\)  This shows that \(2\mathbb{Z}\cap  3\mathbb{Z}\subseteq  6\mathbb{Z}\text{.}\) The opposite containment can easily be established; therefore, \(2\mathbb{Z} \cap  3\mathbb{Z}
= 6\mathbb{Z}\text{.}\)</p></li>
