<p>Consider the partial ordering “divides” on \(L = \{1, 3, 5, 7, 15, 21, 35, 105\}\text{.}\) Then \((L, \mid)\) is a poset. To determine the least upper bound of 3 and 7, we look for all \(u  \in  L\text{,}\) such that \(3|u\) and \(7|u\text{.}\) Certainly, both \(u  = 21\) and \(u  = 105\) satisfy these conditions and no other element of \(L\) does. Next, since \(21|105\text{,}\)  \(21\) is the least upper bound of 3 and 7. Similarly, the  least upper bound of 3 and 5 is 15. The greatest element of \(L\) is 105 since \(a|105\) for all \(a \in  L\text{.}\) To find the greatest lower bound of 15 and 35, we first consider all elements \(g\) of \(L\) such that \(g \mid 15\text{.}\)  They are 1, 3, 5, and 15.  The elements for which  \(g \mid 35\) are 1, 5, 7, and 35. From these two lists, we see that \(\ell = 5\) and \(\ell = 1\) satisfy the required conditions. But since \(1|5\text{,}\)  the greatest lower bound is 5. The least element of \(L\) is 1 since \(1|a\) for all \(a \in  L\text{.}\)</p>
