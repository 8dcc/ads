<li><p>The integers with addition is a group. We know that addition is associative.  Zero is the identity for addition: \(0 + n = n + 0 = n\) for all integers \(n\text{.}\) The additive inverse of any integer is obtained by negating it.  Thus the inverse of \(n\) is \(-n\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>The integers with multiplication is not a group. Although multiplication is associative and 1 is the identity for multiplication, not all integers have a multiplicative inverse in \(\mathbb{Z}\text{.}\)  For example, the multiplicative inverse of 10 is \(\frac{1}{10}\text{,}\) but \(\frac{1}{10}\) is not an integer.</p></li>
<li><p>The power set of any set \(U\) with the operation of symmetric difference, \(\oplus\text{,}\) is a group. If \(A\) and \(B\) are sets, then \(A\oplus B=(A\cup B)-(A\cap B)\text{.}\) We will leave it to the reader to prove that \(\oplus\) is associative over \(\mathcal{P}(U)\text{.}\) The identity of the group is the empty set: \(A\oplus  \emptyset  = A\text{.}\) Every set is its own inverse since \(A \oplus  A = \emptyset\text{.}\) Note that \(\mathcal{P}(U)\) is not a group with union or intersection.</p></li>
