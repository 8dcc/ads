<p>At the axiomatic and universal levels, there are often symbols that have a special meaning attached to them. In group theory, the letter \(e\) is used to denote the identity element of whatever group is being discussed. A little later, we will prove that the inverse of a group element, \(a\text{,}\) is unique and its inverse is usually denoted \(a^{-1}\) and is read “\(a\) inverse.” When a concrete group is discussed, these symbols are dropped in favor of concrete symbols. These concrete symbols may or may not be similar to the generic symbols. For example, the identity element of the group of integers is 0, and the inverse of \(n\) is denoted by \(-n\text{,}\) the additive inverse of \(n\text{.}\)</p>
