<body><article class="example-like"><p>Consider the graph, \(G\text{,}\) in the top left of <a data-knowl="./knowl/fig-subgraphs.html" title="Figure 9.1.18">FigureÂ 9.1.18</a>.  The other three graphs in that figure are all subgraphs of \(G\text{.}\)  The graph in the top right was created by first removing vertex 5 and all edges connecting it.  In addition, we have removed the edge \(\{1,4\}\text{.}\)   That removed edge disqualifies the graph from being an induced subgraph.  The graphs in the bottom left and right are both spanning subgraphs.  The one on the bottom right is a tree, and is referred to as a spanning subtree.  Spanning subtrees will be a discussed in Chapter 10.</p>
