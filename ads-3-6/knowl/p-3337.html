<p>For the network in <a data-knowl="./knowl/fig-water-network.html" title="Figure 9.5.18">FigureÂ 9.5.18</a>, one flow is \(f_1\text{,}\) defined by \(f_1\left(e_1\right)=25\text{,}\) \(f_1\left(e_2\right)=20\text{,}\) \(f_1\left(e_3\right)=0\text{,}\) \(f_1\left(e_4\right)= 25\text{,}\) and \(f_1\left(e_5\right)=20\text{.}\) The value of \(f_1\text{,}\) \(V\left(f_1\right)\text{,}\) is 45. Since the total flow into the sink can be no larger than 50 (\(w \left(e_4\right) + w \left(e_5\right) = 30 + 20\)), we can tell that \(f_1\) is not very far from the solution. Can you improve on \(f_1\) at all? The sum of the capacities into the sink can't always be obtained by a flow. The same is true for the sum of the capacities out of the source. In this case, the sum of the capacities out of the source is 60, which obviously can't be reached in this network.</p>
