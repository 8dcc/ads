<p>The arrows pointing up indicate that if a letter is postmarked, it is taken off the conveyor belt for delivery. If a letter reaches the end, it must not have a stamp. Letter-facing machines like this have been designed (see Gallian's paper). One economic consideration is that \(R\)-machines tend to cost more than \(F\)-machines. \(R\)-machines also tend to damage more letters. Taking these facts into consideration, the reader is invited to design a better letter-facing machine. Assume that \(R\)-machines cost \(\$800\) and \(F\)-machines cost \(\$500\text{.}\) Be sure that all corners of incoming letters will be examined as they go down the conveyor belt.</p>
