<p>We could, for example, let \(A = \{1, 2\}\text{,}\) \(B = \{5, 8, 10\}\text{,}\) and \(C = \{3, 2, 5\}\text{,}\) and determine whether the distributive law is true for these values of \(A\text{,}\) \(B\text{,}\) and \(C\text{.}\) In doing this we will have only determined that the distributive law is true for this one example. It does not prove the distributive law for all possible sets \(A\text{,}\) \(B\text{,}\) and \(C\) and hence is an invalid method of proof. However, trying a few examples has considerable merit insofar as it makes us more comfortable with the statement in question. Indeed, if the statement is not true for the example, we have disproved the statement.</p>
