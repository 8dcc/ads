<li><p>If \(f\) and \(g\) are permutations of \(A\text{,}\) then they are both injections and their composition, \(f\circ g\text{,}\) is a injection, by <a data-knowl="./knowl/theorem-composition-of-injections.html" title="Theorem 7.3.6: The composition of injections is an injection">Theorem 7.3.6</a>. By <a data-knowl="./knowl/theorem-composition-of-surjections.html" title="Theorem 7.3.7: The composition of surjections is a surjection">Theorem 7.3.7</a>, \(f\circ g\) is also a surjection; therefore, \(f\circ g\) is a bijection on \(A\text{,}\) a permutation.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Proof by induction: Basis: \((n=1)\text{.}\)  The number of permutations of \(A\) is one, the identity function, and 1! \(=1\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Induction: Assume that the number of permutations on a set with \(n\) elements, \(n\geq 1\text{,}\) is \(n\text{!.}\) Furthermore, assume that \(|A|=\)\(\text{  }n+1\) and that \(A\) contains an element called \(\sigma\text{.}\) Let \(A'=A-\{\sigma\}\text{.}\) We can reduce the definition of a permutation, \(f\text{,}\) on \(A\) to two steps. First, we select any one of the \(n\text{!}\) permutations on \(A'\text{.}\) (Note the use of the induction hypothesis.) Call it \(g\text{.}\) This permutation almost completely defines a permutation on \(A\) that we will call  \(f\text{.}\)  For all \(a\) in \(A'\text{,}\) we start by defining \(f(a)\) to be \(g(a)\text{.}\) We may be making some adjustments, but define it that way for now. Next, we select the image of \(\sigma\text{,}\) which can be done \(n+1\) different ways, allowing for any value in \(A\text{.}\) To keep our function bijective, we must adjust \(f\) as follows: If we select \(f(\sigma)=y \neq \sigma\text{,}\) then we must find the element, \(z\text{,}\) of \(A\) such that \(g(z)=y\text{,}\) and redefine the image  of \(z\) to \(f(z)=\sigma\text{.}\) If we had selected \(f(\sigma)=\sigma\text{,}\) then there is  no adjustment needed. By the rule of products, the number of ways that we can define \(f\) is \(n!(n+1)=(n+1)!\) \(\square\)</p>
