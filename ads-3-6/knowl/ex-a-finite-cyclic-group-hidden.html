<body><article class="example-like"><p>\(\mathbb{Z}_{12} = [\mathbb{Z}_{12}; +_{12} ]\text{,}\)  where \(+_{12}\) is addition modulo 12, is a cyclic group. To verify this statement, all we need to do is demonstrate that some element of \(\mathbb{Z}_{12}\)  is a generator. One such element is 5; that is, \(\langle 5 \rangle = \mathbb{Z}_{12}\text{.}\) One more obvious generator is 1. In fact, 1 is a generator of every \([\mathbb{Z}_n; +_n]\text{.}\) The reader is asked to prove that if an element is a generator, then its inverse is also a generator. Thus, \(-5 = 7\) and \(-1 = 11\) are the other generators of \(\mathbb{Z}_{12}\text{.}\) The remaining eight elements of the group are not generators.</p>

A string is tied to tack 0, and is then looped around every fifth tack. As a result, the numbers of the tacks that are reached are exactly the ordered multiples of 5 modulo 12: 5, 10, 3, ... , 7, 0.  Note that if every seventh tack were used, the same artwork would be produced. If every third tack were connected, as in <a data-knowl="./knowl/fig-string-art.html" title="Figure 15.1.3">Figure 15.1.3</a>(b), the resulting loop would only use four tacks; thus 3 does not generate \(\mathbb{Z}_{12}\text{.}\)</p></article></body>
