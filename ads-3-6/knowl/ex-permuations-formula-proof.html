</h6>
<p>In Chapter 2, we stated that the number of different permutations of \(k\) elements taken from an \(n\) element set, \(P(n; k)\text{,}\) can be computed with the formula \(\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}\text{.}\) We can prove this statement by induction on \(n\text{.}\) For \(n \geq  0\text{,}\) let \(q(n)\) be the proposition</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
P(n; k) = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!} \textrm{  for all } k \textrm{, } 0 \le k \le n\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Basis: \(q(0)\) states that  \(P(0; 0) \) if is the number of ways that \(0\) elements can be selected from the empty set and arranged in order, then \(P(0; 0) = \frac{0!}{0!} = 1 \text{.}\)  This is true. A general law in combinatorics is that there is exactly one way of doing nothing.</p>
<p>Induction: Assume that \(q(n)\) is true for some natural number \(n\text{.}\) It is left for us to prove that this assumption implies that \(q(n +1)\) is true. Suppose that we have a set of cardinality \(n + 1\) and want to select and arrange \(k\) of its elements. There are two cases to consider, the first of which is easy. If \(k = 0\text{,}\) then there is one way of selecting zero elements from the set; hence</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
P(n + 1; 0) = 1 =\frac{(n+1)!}{(n+1+0)!}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>and the formula works in this case.</p>
<p>The more challenging case is to verify the formula when \(k\) is positive and less than or equal to \(n+1\text{.}\) Here we count the value of \(P(n+ 1; k)\) by counting the number of ways that the first element in the arrangement can be filled and then counting the number of ways that the remaining \(k -1\) elements can be filled in using the induction hypothesis.</p>
<p>There are \(n + 1\) possible choices for the first element. Since that leaves \(n\) elements to fill in the remaining \(k - 1\) positions, there are \(P(n; k - 1)\) ways of completing the arrangement. By the rule of products,</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
P(n +1;k) &amp;= (n+1) P(n;k-1) \\
&amp; = (n+1) \frac{n!}{(n-(k-1))!} \\
&amp; = \frac{(n+1) n!}{(n-k+1)!}\\
&amp; = \frac{(n+1)!}{((n+1)-k)!}
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
