<p>(Concrete) We can verify that \(2\mathbb{Z} \leq  \mathbb{Z}\text{,}\) as stated in <a data-knowl="./knowl/ex-subsystems.html" title="Example 11.5.2: Examples of Subsystems">Example 11.5.2</a>. Whenever you want to discuss a subset, you must find some convenient way of describing its elements. An element of \(2\mathbb{Z}\) can be described as 2 times an integer; that is, \(a \in  2\mathbb{Z}\) is equivalent to \((\exists k)_{\mathbb{Z}}(a = 2k)\text{.}\) Now we can verify that the three conditions of <a data-knowl="./knowl/th-subgroup-conditions.html" title="Theorem 11.5.3: Subgroup Conditions">Theorem 11.5.3</a> are true for 2\(\mathbb{Z}\text{.}\) First, if \(a, b \in  2\mathbb{Z}\text{,}\) then there exist \(j, k \in  \mathbb{Z}\) such that \(a = 2j\) and \(b = 2k\text{.}\)   A common error is to write something like  \(a=2j\)  and \(b=2j\text{.}\)  This would mean that \(a=b\text{,}\) which is not necessarily true.   That is why two different variables are needed to describe \(a\) and \(b\text{.}\)  Returning to our proof, we can add \(a\) and \(b\text{:}\) \(a + b = 2j + 2k = 2(j + k)\text{.}\) Since \(j + k\) is an integer, \(a + b\) is an element of \(2\mathbb{Z}\text{.}\)   Second, the identity, \(0\text{,}\) belongs to 2\(\mathbb{Z}\) (\(0 = 2(0)\)).  Finally, if \(a \in  2\mathbb{Z}\) and \(a = 2k, -a = -(2k) = 2(-k)\text{,}\) and  \(-k\in \mathbb{Z}\text{,}\)  therefore, \(-a \in  2\mathbb{Z}\text{.}\) By <a data-knowl="./knowl/th-subgroup-conditions.html" title="Theorem 11.5.3: Subgroup Conditions">Theorem 11.5.3</a>, \(2\mathbb{Z} \leq  \mathbb{Z}\text{.}\) How would this argument change if you were asked to prove that \(3\mathbb{Z} \leq  \mathbb{Z}\text{?}\) or \(n \mathbb{Z} \leq  \mathbb{Z}, n \geq  2\text{?}\)</p>
