<p>One set of subgraphs of any graph is the connected components of a graph.  For simplicity, we will define them for undirected graphs.   Given a graph  \(G=(V,E)\text{,}\) consider the relation “is connected to” on \(V\text{.}\)  We interprete this relation so that each vertex is connected to itself, and any two distinct vertices are related if there is a path along edges of the graph from one to the other.  It shouldn't be too difficult convince yourself that this is an equivalence relation on \(V\text{.}\)</p>
