<p>An application of \(D_4\) is in the design of a letter-facing machine.  Imagine letters entering a conveyor belt to be postmarked. They are placed on the conveyor belt at random so that two sides are parallel to the belt. Suppose that a postmarker can recognize a stamp in the top right corner of the envelope, on the side facing up. In <a data-knowl="./knowl/fig-letter-facer.html" title="Figure 15.3.27">FigureÂ 15.3.27</a>, a sequence of machines is shown that will recognize a stamp on any letter, no matter what position in which the letter starts. The letter \(P\) stands for a postmarker. The letters \(R\) and \(F\) stand for rotating and flipping machines that perform the motions of \(r_1\) and \(f_1\text{.}\)</p>

<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span> <span class="codenumber">15.3.27.</span> A letter facer</figcaption></figure><p>The arrows pointing up indicate that if a letter is postmarked, it is taken off the conveyor belt for delivery. If a letter reaches the end, it must not have a stamp. Letter-facing machines like this have been designed (see Gallian's paper). One economic consideration is that \(R\)-machines tend to cost more than \(F\)-machines. \(R\)-machines also tend to damage more letters. Taking these facts into consideration, the reader is invited to design a better letter-facing machine. Assume that \(R\)-machines cost \(\$800\) and \(F\)-machines cost \(\$500\text{.}\) Be sure that all corners of incoming letters will be examined as they go down the conveyor belt.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s-permutation-groups.html#ex-letter-facing-machine">in-context</a></span>
