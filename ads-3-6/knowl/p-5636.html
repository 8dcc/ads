<p>Noisy three-bit message blocks are difficult to transmit because they are so similar to one another. If \(a\) and \(b\) are in \(\mathbb{Z}_2{}^3\text{,}\) their difference, \(a +_2 b\text{,}\) can be thought of as a measure of how close they are. If \(a\) and \(b\) differ in only one bit position, one error can change one into the other. The encoding that we will introduce takes a block \(a = \left(a_1, a_2, a_3 \right)\) and produces a block of length 6 called the <dfn class="terminology">code word</dfn> of \(a\text{.}\) The code words are selected so that they are farther from one another than the messages are. In fact, each code word will differ from each other code word by at least three bits. As a result, any single error will not push a code word close enough to another code word to cause confusion. Now for the details.</p>
