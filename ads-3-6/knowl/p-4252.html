<p>How do you decide that two groups are not isomorphic to one another? The negation of “\(G\) and \(H\) are isomorphic” is that no translation rule between \(G\) and \(H\) exists. If \(G\) and \(H\) have different cardinalities, then no bijection from \(G\) into \(H\) can exist. Hence they are not isomorphic. Given that \(\left| G\right| =\left| H\right|\text{,}\) it is usually impractical to list all bijections from \(G\) into \(H\) and show that none of them satisfy Condition b of the formal definition. The best way to prove that two groups are not isomorphic is to find a true statement about one group that is not true about the other group. We illustrate this method in the following checklist that you can apply to most pairs of non-isomorphic groups in this book.</p>
