<p>Starting at \(v_1\) in \(G-v\text{,}\) suppose we try to construct a path \(v_3\) that passes through only red and blue vertices.  This can either be accomplished or it can't be accomplished. If it can't be done, consider all paths that start at \(v_1\text{,}\) and go through only red and blue vertices. If we exchange the colors of the vertices in these paths, including \(v_1\) we still have a 5-coloring of \(G - v\text{.}\) Since \(v_1\) is now blue, we can color the central vertex, \(v\text{,}\) red.</p>
