<p>As we mentioned at the outset of this section, finite-state machines can recognize strings in a regular language. Consider the language \(L\) over \(\{a,b,c\}\) that contains the strings of positive length in which each \(a\) is followed by \(b\) and each \(b\) is followed by \(c\text{.}\) One such string is \(bccabcbc\text{.}\) This language is regular. A grammar for the language would be nonterminal symbols \(\{A,B,C\}\) with starting symbol \(C\) and production rules \(A\to bB\text{,}\) \(B\to cC\text{,}\) \(C\to aA\text{,}\) \(C\to bB\text{,}\) \(C \to cC\text{,}\) \(C \to c\text{.}\) A finite-state machine (<a data-knowl="./knowl/fig-recognition-machine.html" title="Figure 14.3.8">FigureÂ 14.3.8</a>) that recognizes this language can be constructed with one state for each nonterminal symbol and an additional state (Reject) that is entered if any invalid production takes place. At the end of an input tape that encodes a string in \(\{a,b,c\}^*\text{,}\) we will know when the string belongs to \(L\) based on the final output. If the final output is 1, the string belongs to \(L\) and if it is 0, the string does not belong to \(L\text{.}\) In addition, recognition can be accomplished by examining the final state of the machine. The input string belongs to the language if and only if the final state is \(C\text{.}\)</p>

<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span> <span class="codenumber">14.3.8.</span> </figcaption></figure><p>The construction of this machine is quite easy: note how each production rule translates into an edge between states other than Reject. For example, \(C\to bB\) indicates that in State \(C\text{,}\) an input of \(b\) places the machine into State \(B\text{.}\) Not all sets of production rules can be as easily translated to a finite-state machine. Another set of production rules for \(L\) is \(A\to aB\text{,}\) \(B\to bC\text{,}\) \(C\to cA\text{,}\) \(C\to cB\text{,}\) \(C\to cC\) and \(C\to c\text{.}\) Techniques for constructing finite-state machines from production rules is not our objective here. Hence we will only expect you to experiment with production rules until appropriate ones are found.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s-automata-finite-state-machines.html#ex-problem-recognition-in-reg-languages">in-context</a></span>
