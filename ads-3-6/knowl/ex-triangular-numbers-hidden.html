<body><article class="example-like"><p>Consider the following proposition over the positive integers, which we will label \(p(n)\text{:}\) The sum of the positive integers from 1 to \(n\) is \(\frac{n (n+1)}{2}\text{.}\) This is a well-known formula that is quite simple to verify for a given value of \(n\text{.}\)   For example, \(p(5)\) is: The sum of the positive integers from 1 to 5 is \(\frac{5 (5+1)}{2}\text{.}\) Indeed, \(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5= 15 =\frac{5(5+1)}{2}\text{.}\) However, this doesn't serve as a proof that \(p(n)\) is a tautology. All that we've established is that \(5\) is in the truth set of \(p\text{.}\) Since the positive integers are infinite, we certainly can't use this approach to prove the formula.</p></article></body>
