<p>(Axiomatic) If \(H\) and \(K\) are both subgroups of a group \(G\text{,}\) then \(H \cap  K\) is a subgroup of \(G\text{.}\) To justify this statement, we have no concrete information to work with, only the facts that \(H \leq  G\) and \(K \leq G\text{.}\) Our proof that \(H \cap  K \leq  G\) reflects this and is an exercise in applying the definitions of intersection and subgroup, (i) If \(a\) and \(b\) are elements of \(H \cap K\text{,}\) then \(a\) and \(b\) both belong to \(H\text{,}\) and since \(H \leq  G\text{,}\) \(a * b\) must be an element of \(H\text{.}\) Similarly, \(a * b \in  K\text{;}\) therefore, \(a * b \in  H \cap  K\text{.}\) (ii) The identity of \(G\) must belong to both \(H\) and \(K\text{;}\) hence it belongs to \(H \cap  K\text{.}\) (iii) If \(a \in H \cap K\text{,}\) then \(a \in 
H\text{,}\) and since \(H \leq  G\text{,}\) \(a^{-1}\in  H\text{.}\)  Similarly, \(a^{-1}\in K\text{.}\) Hence, by the theorem,  \(H \cap  K \leq  G\text{.}\) Now that this fact has been established, we can apply it to any pair of subgroups of any group. For example, since \(2\mathbb{Z}\) and \(3\mathbb{Z}\) are both subgroups of \([\mathbb{Z};+]\text{,}\) \(2\mathbb{Z} \cap  3\mathbb{Z}\) is also a subgroup of \(\mathbb{Z}\text{.}\) Note that if \(a \in 2\mathbb{Z}
\cap  3\mathbb{Z}\text{,}\)  \(a\) must have a factor of 3; that is, there exists \(k\in \mathbb{Z}\) such that \(a = 3k\text{.}\) In addition, \(a\) must be even, therefore \(k\) must be even. There exists \(j \in  \mathbb{Z}\) such that \(k = 2j\text{,}\) therefore \(a = 3(2j)= 6j\text{.}\)  This shows that \(2\mathbb{Z}\cap  3\mathbb{Z}\subseteq  6\mathbb{Z}\text{.}\) The opposite containment can easily be established; therefore, \(2\mathbb{Z} \cap  3\mathbb{Z}
= 6\mathbb{Z}\text{.}\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s-Subsystems.html#li-1863">in-context</a></span>
