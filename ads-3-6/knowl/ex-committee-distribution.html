</h6>
<p>Suppose that an organization is divided into three geographic sections, A, B, and C. Suppose that an executive committee of 11 members must be selected so that no more than 5 members from any one section are on the committee and that Sections A, B, and C must have minimums of 3, 2, and 2 members, respectively, on the committee. Looking only at the number of members from each section on the committee, how many ways can the committee be made up? One example of a valid committee would be 4 A's, 4 B's, and 3 C's.</p>
<p>Let \(P_A\) be the action of deciding how many members (not who) from Section A will serve on the committee. \(X_A= \{3, 4, 5\}\) and \(Q_A(k)=k\text{.}\) The frequency function, \(F_A\) , is defined by \(F_A(k)=1\) if \(k\in X_k\) , with \(F_A(k)=0\) otherwise. \(G\left(F_A;z\right)\) is then \(z^3+
z^4+z^5\) . Similarly, \(G\left(F_B;z\right) =z^2+ z^3+ z ^4 + z^5= G\left(F_C ;z\right)\text{.}\) Since the committee must have 11 members, our answer will be the coefficient of \(z^{11}\) in \(G\left(F_A;z\right)G\left(F_B;z\right)G\left(F_C;z\right)\text{,}\) which is 10.</p>
