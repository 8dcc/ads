<p>We are all somewhat familiar with \(\mathbb{Z}_{12}\) since the hours of the day are counted using this group, except for the fact that 12 is used in place of 0.  Military time uses the mod 24 system and does begin at 0.  If someone started a four-hour trip at hour 21, the time at which she would arrive is \(21 +_{24} 4 = 1\text{.}\) If a satellite orbits the earth every four hours and starts its first orbit at hour 5, it would end its first orbit at time  \(5 +_{24}4 =9\text{.}\) Its tenth orbit would end at \(5 +_{24} 10\times_{24}4 =21\) hours on the clock</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s-gcds-and-zsubn.html#li-1806">in-context</a></span>
