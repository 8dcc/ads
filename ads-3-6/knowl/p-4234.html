<p>This isomorphism is between\(\left[\mathbb{R}^+ ; \cdot \right]\) and \([\mathbb{R};+]\text{.}\) Until the 1970s, when the price of calculators dropped, multiplication and exponentiation were performed with an isomorphism between these systems. The isomorphism \(\left(\mathbb{R}^+\right.\) to \(\mathbb{R}\)) between the two groups is that \(\cdot\) is translated into \(+\) and any positive real number \(a\) is translated to the logarithm of \(a\text{.}\) To translate back from \(\mathbb{R}\) to \(\mathbb{R}^+\) , you invert the logarithm function. If base ten logarithms are used, an element of \(\mathbb{R}\text{,}\) \(b\text{,}\) will be translated to \(10^b\text{.}\)  In pre-calculator days, the translation was done with a table of logarithms or with a slide rule. An example of how the isomorphism is used appears in <a data-knowl="./knowl/fig-log-mult.html" title="Figure 11.7.8">FigureÂ 11.7.8</a>.</p>
