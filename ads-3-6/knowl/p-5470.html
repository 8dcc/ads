<p>Consider the sliding-tile puzzles pictured in <a data-knowl="./knowl/fig-sliding-tile.html" title="Figure 15.3.21">FigureÂ 15.3.21</a>. Each numbered square is a tile and the dark square is a gap. Any tile that is adjacent to the gap can slide into the gap. In most versions of this puzzle, the tiles are locked into a frame so that they can be moved only in the manner described above. The object of the puzzle is to arrange the tiles as they appear in Configuration (a).  Configurations (b) and (c) are typical starting points. We propose to show why the puzzle can be solved starting with (b), but not with (c).</p>
