<ul class="disc">
<li>By the reflexive property, each vertex must be related to itself, so the arrows from a vertex to itself (called “self-loops”) are not drawn in a Hasse diagram. They are simply assumed.</li>
<li>By the antisymmetry property, connections between two distinct elements in a directed graph can only go one way, if at all.  When there is a connection, we agree to always place the second element above the first (as we do above with the connection from \(\{1\}\) to \(\{1,2\}\)). For this reason, we can just draw a connection without an arrow, just a line.</li>
<li>By the transitive property, if there are edges connecting one element up to a second element and the second element up to a third element, then there will be a direct connection from the first to the third. We see this in <a data-knowl="./knowl/fig-graph-6-2-subsets-2.html" title="Figure 6.2.6">Figure 6.2.6</a> with \(\emptyset\) connected to \(\{1\}\)\(\)and then \(\{1\}\) connected to \(\{1,2\}\text{.}\) Notice the edge connecting \(\emptyset\) to \(\{1,2\}\text{.}\)  Whenever we identify this situation, remove the connection from the first to the third in a Hasse diagram and simply observe that an upward path of any length implies that the lower element is related to the upper one.</li>
