<p>The set of atoms of the Boolean algebra \(\left[D_{30}; \lor , \land, \bar{\hspace{5 mm}}\right]\) is \(M = \{2, 3, 5\}\text{.}\) To see that \(a = 2\) is an atom, let \(x\) be any nonzero element of \(D_{30}\) and note that one of the two conditions \(x \land  2 = 2\) or \(x \land
2 = 1\) holds. Of course, to apply the definition to this Boolean algebra, we must remind ourselves that in this case the 0-element is 1, the operation \(\land\) is greatest common divisor, and the poset relation is “divides.” So if \(x = 10\text{,}\) we have \(10 \land  2 = 2\) (or \(2 \mid 10\)), so Condition 1 holds. If \(x = 15\text{,}\) the first condition is not true. (Why?) However, Condition 2, \(15 \land  2 = 1\text{,}\) is true. The reader is encouraged to show that 3 and 5 also satisfy the definition of an atom. Next, if we should compute the join (the least common multiple in this case) of all possible combinations of the atoms 2, 3, and 5 to generate all nonzero (non-1 in this case) elements of \(D_{30}\text{.}\) For example, \(2 \lor  3 \lor  5 = 30\) and \(2 \lor  5 = 10\text{.}\) We state this concept formally in the following theorem, which we give without proof.</p>
