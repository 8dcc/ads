<p>If you were to deposit a certain amount of money at the end of each year for a number of years, this sequence of payments would be called an annuity (see <a data-knowl="./knowl/ex-a-novel-annuity.html" title="Example 8.3.21: A Sort of Annuity">ExampleÂ 8.3.21</a>).</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Find a closed form expression for the balance or value of an annuity that consists of payments of \(q\) dollars at a rate of interest of \(i\text{.}\) Note that for a normal annuity, the first payment is made after one year.</p></li>
<li><p>With an interest rate of 5.5 percent, how much would you need to deposit into an annuity to have a value of one million dollars after 18 years?</p></li>
<li><p>The payment of a loan is a form of annuity in which the initial value is some negative amount (the amount of the loan) and the annuity ends when the value is raised to zero. How much could you borrow if you can afford to pay $5,000 per year for 25 years at 11 percent interest?</p></li>
