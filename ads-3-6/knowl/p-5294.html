<p><a data-knowl="./knowl/fig-string-art.html" title="Figure 15.1.3">Figure 15.1.3</a>(a)  is an example of “string art” that illustrates how 5 generates \(\mathbb{Z}_{12}\text{.}\) Twelve tacks are placed evenly around a circle and numbered 0 through 11. A string is tied to tack 0, and is then looped around every fifth tack. As a result, the numbers of the tacks that are reached are exactly the ordered multiples of 5 modulo 12: 5, 10, 3, ... , 7, 0.  Note that if every seventh tack were used, the same artwork would be produced. If every third tack were connected, as in <a data-knowl="./knowl/fig-string-art.html" title="Figure 15.1.3">Figure 15.1.3</a>(b), the resulting loop would only use four tacks; thus 3 does not generate \(\mathbb{Z}_{12}\text{.}\)</p>
