<p>Let \(p_1= \left(e_1, e_2, \ldots , e_m \right)\) and \(p_2=\left(f_1,f_2,\ldots , f_n\right)\) be two different simple paths from \(v_a\) to \(v_b\text{.}\) The first step we will take is to delete from \(p_1\) and \(p_2\) the initial edges that are identical. That is, if \(e_1= f_1\text{,}\) \(e_2= f_2, \dots \text{,}\) \(e_{j}= f_j\text{,}\) and \(e_{j+1}\neq f_{j+1}\) delete the first \(j\) edges of both paths. Once this is done, both paths start at the same vertex, call it \(v_c\text{,}\) and both still end at \(v_b\text{.}\) Now we construct a cycle by starting at \(v_c\) and following what is left of \(p_1\) until we first meet what is left of \(p_2\text{.}\) If this first meeting occurs at vertex \(v_d\text{,}\) then the remainder of the cycle is completed by following the portion of the reverse of \(p_2\) that starts at \(v_d\) and ends at \(v_c\text{.}\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s-what-is-a-tree.html#proof-27">in-context</a></span>
