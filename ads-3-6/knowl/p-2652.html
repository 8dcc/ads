<p>With the aid of a computer (or possibly only a calculator), we can increase \(n\text{.}\) Approximations of the characteristic roots can be obtained by any of several well-known methods, some of which are part of standard software packages. There is no general rule that specifies the values of \(n\) for which numerical approximations will be feasible. The accuracy that you get will depend on the relation that you try to solve. (See Exercise 17 of this section.)</p>
