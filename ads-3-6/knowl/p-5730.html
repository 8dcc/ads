<p>We already know that they behave identically under addition, so if they are different as rings, it must have something to do with how they behave under the operation of multiplication. Let's begin to develop a checklist of how the two rings could differ:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>Do they have the same cardinality? Yes, they are both countable.</p></li>
<li><p>Are they both commutative? Yes.</p></li>
<li><p>Are they both rings with unity? No.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>\(\mathbb{Z}\) is a ring with unity, namely the number 1.   2\(\mathbb{Z}\) is not a ring with unity, \(1\notin 2\mathbb{Z}\text{.}\)  Hence, they are not isomorphic as rings.</p>
