<p>By now, you realize that mathematicians tend to generalize. Once we have found a “good thing,” something that is useful, we apply it to as many different concepts as possible. In doing so, we frequently find that the “different concepts” are not really different but only look different. Four sentences in four different languages might look dissimilar, but when they are translated into a common language, they might very well express the exact same idea.</p>
