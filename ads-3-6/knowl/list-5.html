<div class="introduction"><p>From the conditions of this message, it should be clear that if everyone cooperates and if coaches participate within a day of receiving the message:</p></div>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>If a path of length \(n\) exists from MSU to ESU, then the coach will know about it in \(n\) days.</p></li>
<li><p>By making a series of phone calls, the coach can construct a path that he wants by first calling the coach who defeated ESU (the person who sent ESU's coach that message). This coach will know who sent him a letter, and so on. Therefore, the vertex list of the desired path is constructed in reverse order.</p></li>
<li><p>If a total of \(M\) football games were played, no more than \(M\) messages will be sent out.</p></li>
<li><p>If a day passes without any message being sent out, no path from MSU to ESU exists.</p></li>
<li><p>This method could be extended to construct a list of all teams that a given team can be connected to. Simply imagine a series of letters like the one above sent by each football coach and targeted at every other coach.</p></li>
