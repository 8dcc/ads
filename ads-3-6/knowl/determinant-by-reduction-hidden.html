<body><article class="example-like"><p>We will apply some of these properties, most notably the first and third of <a data-knowl="./knowl/determinant-properties.html" title="Theorem C.2.1: Properties of Determinants">TheoremÂ 1</a>, to compute a four by four determinant without doing as many multiplications as expected.  We will use SageMath to do the calculations for us.  In SageMath, as in Python, numbering starts at zero, so we will describe the process using that numbering system.  Let \(A=\begin{pmatrix}1 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 7\\
1 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 4\\
6 &amp; 6 &amp; 7 &amp; 8\\
3 &amp; 3 &amp; 7 &amp; 5
\end{pmatrix}\)</p>
<p>Our strategy will be to create a column that is mostly zero so that we can expand along that column and only need to compute one cofactor.  That will be the 0th column.  To do that we do the following row operations.  We subtract row 0 from row 1, replacing row 1 with that result.  Then we subtract six time row 0 from row 2, producing a new row 2.  Finally, three times row 0 is subtracted from row 3 to produce a new row 3.  The SageMath code below accomplishes this and produces a new matrix, \(B\text{,}\) which has the same determinant.</p>
<div class="sagecell-sage" id="sage-79"><script type="text/x-sage">A=matrix([[1,3,4,7],[2,3,4,4],[5,6,7,4],[3,3,7,5]])
B=matrix([A[0],A[1]-2*A[0],A[2]-5*A[0],A[3]-3*A[0]]);B
</script></div>
<p>Expanding this matrix along the column zero, we need only compute a single three by three cofactor.  We will go one step further and do row operations to get a matrix with zeros in rows 2 and 3 of column 1.  The SageMath code below tells what we are doing.</p>
<div class="sagecell-sage" id="sage-80"><script type="text/x-sage">C=matrix([B[0],B[1],B[2]-3*B[1],B[3]-2*B[1]]);C
</script></div>
<p>We are at a point where we can do the final calculation very easily.</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\lvert A \rvert = \lvert C \rvert = 1 \cdot(-3 \cdot (-1\cdot 4 - 3\cdot (-1)))= 3
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>SageMath has a determinant function, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">det</code>, that we can use to verify this calculation:</p>
<div class="sagecell-sage" id="sage-81"><script type="text/x-sage">A=matrix([[1,3,4,7],[2,3,4,4],[5,6,7,4],[3,3,7,5]])
det(A)
