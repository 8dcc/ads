<p>Another universal concept that applies to the theory of rings is that of a subsystem. A subring of a ring \([R; +, \cdot ]\) is any nonempty subset \(S\) of \(R\) that is a ring under the operations of \(R\text{.}\) First, for \(S\) to be a subring of the ring \(R\text{,}\) \(S\) must be a subgroup of the group \([R; +]\text{.}\) Also, \(S\) must be closed under \(\cdot\text{,}\) satisfy the associative law under \(\cdot\text{,}\) and satisfy the distributive laws. But since \(R\) is a ring, the associative and distributive laws are true for every element in \(R\text{,}\) and, in particular, for all elements in \(S\text{,}\) since \(S\subseteq R\text{.}\) We have just proven the following theorem:</p>
