<p>To search for a path that uses every vertex of a graph exactly once seems to be a natural next problem after you have considered Eulerian graphs.The Irish mathematician Sir William Rowan Hamilton (1805-65) is given credit for first defining such paths. He is also credited with discovering the quaternions, for which he was honored by the Irish government with a postage stamp in 2004.</p>
