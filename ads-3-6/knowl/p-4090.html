<p>For every group with at least two elements, there are at least two subgroups: they are the whole group and \(\{e\}\text{.}\) Since these two are automatic, they are not considered very interesting and are called the improper subgroups of the group; \(\{e\}\) is sometimes referred to as the trivial subgroup. All other subgroups, if there are any, are called proper subgroups.</p>
