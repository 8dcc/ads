<p>In doing <a data-knowl="./knowl/ex-another-diagonalization.html" title="Example 12.4.8: Diagonalization of a 3 by 3 matrix">Example 12.4.8</a>, the given \(3\times 3\) matrix \(A\) produced only two, not three, distinct eigenvalues, yet we were still able to diagonalize \(A\text{.}\) The reason we were able to do so was because we were able to find three linearly independent eigenvectors. Again, the main idea is to produce a matrix \(P\) that does the diagonalizing. If \(A\) is an \(n \times  n\) matrix, \(P\) will be an \(n\times
n\) matrix, and its \(n\) columns must be linearly independent eigenvectors. The main question in the study of diagonalizability is “When can it be done?” This is summarized in the following theorem.</p>
