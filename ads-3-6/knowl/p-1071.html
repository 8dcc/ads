<p>Theorems are normally expressed in terms of a finite number of propositions, \(p_1, p_2, . . . ,p_n\) , called the <em class="emphasis">premises</em>, and a proposition,\(C\text{,}\) called the <em class="emphasis">conclusion</em>. These theorems take the form</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
p_1\land  p_2\land  \cdots  \land p_n\Rightarrow C
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>or more informally,</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
p_1, p_2, . . . , \textrm{ and } p_n \textrm{ imply } C
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>For a theorem of this type, we say that the premises imply the conclusion. When a theorem is stated, it is assumed that the axioms of the system are true. In addition, any previously proven theorem can be considered an extension of the axioms and can be used in demonstrating that the new theorem is true. When the proof is complete, the new theorem can be used to prove subsequent theorems. A mathematical system can be visualized as an inverted pyramid with the axioms at the base and the theorems expanding out in various directions.</p>
