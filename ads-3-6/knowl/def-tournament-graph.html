<li><p>A complete (or round-robin) tournament graph is a tournament graph with the property that between any two distinct vertices there is exactly one edge.</p></li>
<li><p>A single-elimination tournament graph is a tournament graph with the properties that: (i) one vertex (the champion) has no edge terminating at it and at least one edge initiating from it; (ii) every other vertex is the terminal vertex of exactly one edge; and (iii) there is a path from the champion vertex to every other vertex.</p></li>
