<body><article class="hiddenproof"><p>We prove Euler's Formula by Induction on \(e\text{,}\) for \(e \geq  0\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Basis: If \(e = 0\text{,}\) then \(G\) must be a graph with one vertex, \(v = 1\text{;}\) and there is one infinite region,\(\text{  }r = 1\text{.}\) Therefore, \(v + r-e= 1 + 1-0 = 2\text{,}\) and the basis is true.</p>
<p>Induction: Suppose that \(G\) has \(k\) edges, \(k \geq  1\text{,}\) and that all connected planar graphs with less than \(k\) edges satisfy <a data-knowl="./knowl/euler-formula.html" title="Equation 9.6.1">(9.6.1)</a>. Select any edge that is part of the boundary of the infinite region and call it \(e_1\text{.}\) Let \(G'\) be the graph obtained from \(G\) by deleting \(e_1\text{.}\) <a data-knowl="./knowl/fig-euler-proof-scheme.html" title="Figure 9.6.9">FigureÂ 9.6.9</a> illustrates the two different possibilities we need to consider: either \(G'\) is connected or it has two connected components, \(G_1\) and \(G_2\text{.}\)</p>

<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span> <span class="codenumber">9.6.9.</span> Two cases in the proof of Euler's Formula</figcaption></figure><p>If \(G'\) is connected, the induction hypothesis can be applied to it. If \(G'\) has \(v'\) vertices, \(r'\) edges and \(e'\) edges, then \(v'+r'-e'=2\) and in terms of the corresponding numbers for \(G\text{,}\)</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{ll}
v'=v &amp; \textrm{ No vertices were removed to form } G' \\
r'=r-1 &amp; \textrm{ One region of } G \textrm{ was merged with the infinite region when } e_1 \textrm{ was removed}
\\
e' = k-1 &amp; \textrm{ We assumed that } G \textrm{ had } k \textrm{ edges.} \\
\end{array}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>For the case where \(G'\) is connected,</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
v+ r -e &amp;= v+r-k\\
&amp;= v' + (r'+1) -(e'+1)\\
&amp; = v' + r'-e'\\
&amp; =2
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>If \(G'\) is not connected, it must consist of two connected components, \(G_1\)  and \(G_2\text{,}\) since we started with a connected graph, \(G\text{.}\) We can apply the induction hypothesis to each of the two components to complete the proof. We leave it to the students to do this, with the reminder that in counting regions, \(G_1\)  and \(G_2\)  will share the same infinite region.</p></article></body>
