<p>In this case, there are only three nonempty minsets, producing the partition \(\{\{0,2\},\{1\},\{-2,-1\}\}\text{.}\) An example of a set that could not be produced from just \(B_1\) and \(B_2\) is the set of even elements of \(U\text{,}\) \(\{-2,0,2\}\text{.}\) This is because \(-2\) and \(-1\) cannot be separated. They are in the same minset and any union of minsets either includes or excludes them both.  In general, there are \(2^3= 8\) different minset normal forms because there are three nonempty minsets. This means that only 8 of the \(2^5=32\) subsets of \(U\) could be generated from  any two sets \(B_1\) and \(B_2\text{.}\)</p>
