<p>\((4) \Rightarrow (1)\) Assume that \(G\) contains no cycles and that the addition of an edge creates a cycle. All that we need to prove to verify that \(G\) is a tree is that \(G\) is connected. If it is not connected, then select any two vertices that are not connected. If we add an edge to connect them, the fact that a cycle is created implies that a second path between the two vertices can be found which is in the original graph, which is a contradiction.</p>
