<p>Before we summarize the main results suggested by the previous examples, we should probably consider what could have happened if we had  attempted to perform divisions of polynomials in the ring \(\mathbb{Z}[x]\) rather than in the polynomials over the field \(\mathbb{Z}_2\text{.}\) For example, \(f(x) = x^2 - 1\) and \(g(x)
= 2x - 1\) are  both elements of the ring \(\mathbb{Z}[x]\text{,}\) yet \(x^2-1=(\frac{1}{2} x+\frac{1}{2})(2x-1)-\frac{3}{4}\) The quotient and remainder are not a polynomials over \(\mathbb{Z}\) but polynomials over the field of rational numbers. For this reason it would be wise to describe all results over a field \(F\) rather than over an arbitrary ring \(R\) so that we don't have to expand our possible set of coefficients.</p>
