<p>The main ingredients of these products are flour, sugar and eggs. We assume that other ingredients are always in ample supply, but we need to be sure to have the three main ones available.   For each of the three products, The amount of each ingredient that is needed is summarized in the \(3 \times 3\text{,}\) or “number of products by number of ingredients” matrix \(P\text{.}\)  For example, to bake a cake (second product) we need \(P_{2,1}=1.5\) cups of flour (first ingredient).  Regarding units: flour and sugar are given in cups per unit of each product, while eggs are given in individual eggs per unit of each product.</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
P =\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
2 &amp; 0.5 &amp; 0 \\
1.5 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 \\
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1  \\
\end{array}
\right)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>These amounts are “made up”, so don't used them to do your own baking!</p>
