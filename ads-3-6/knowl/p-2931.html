<p>Let \(A = \{a, b, c, d, e\}\) and let \(A^*\) be the set of all strings of length zero or more that can be made using each of the elements of \(A\) zero or more times. By the generalized rule of products, there are \(5^n\) such strings that have length \(n\text{,}\) \(n\geq 0\text{,}\) Suppose that \(X_n\) is the set of strings of length \(n\) with the property that all of the \(a\)'s and \(b\)'s precede all of the \(c\)'s, \(d\)'s, and \(e\)'s. Thus \(aaabde \in  X_6\text{,}\) but \(abcabc \notin  X_6\text{.}\) Let \(R(n) =\lvert X_n \rvert\text{.}\) A closed form expression for \(R\) can be obtained by recognizing \(R\) as the convolution of two sequences. To illustrate our point, we will consider the calculation of \(R(6)\text{.}\)</p>
