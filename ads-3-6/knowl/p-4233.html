<p>The Isomorphism: Since each system has only one operation, it is clear that union and the OR gate translate into one another. The translation between sets and bit strings is easiest to describe by showing how to construct a set from a bit string. If \(a_1a_2a_3a_4a_5\text{,}\) is a bit string in System 2, the set that it translates to contains the number \(k\) if and only if \(a_k\) equals 1. For example, \(10001\) is translated to the set \(\{1, 5\}\text{,}\) while the set \(\{1, 2\}\) is translated to \(11000.\) Now imagine that your computer is like the child who knows English and must do a Greek problem. To execute a program that has code that includes the set expression \(\{1, 2\} \cup  \{1, 5\}\text{,}\) it will follow the same procedure as the child to obtain the result, as shown in <a data-knowl="./knowl/fig-set-calculation.html" title="Figure 11.7.6">FigureÂ 11.7.6</a>.</p>
