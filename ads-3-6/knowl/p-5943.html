<p>Next we turn to division of polynomials, which is not an operation since the result is a pair of polynomials, not a single one. From high school algebra we all learned the standard procedure for dividing a polynomial \(f(x)\) by a second polynomial \(g(x)\text{.}\) This process of polynomial long division is referred to as the division property for polynomials. Under this scheme we continue to divide until the result is a quotient \(q(x)\) and a remainder \(r(x)\) whose degree is strictly less than that of the divisor \(g(x)\text{.}\) This property is valid over any field. Before giving a formal description, we consider some examples.</p>
