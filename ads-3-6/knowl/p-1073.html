<p>Exactly what constitutes a proof is not always clear. For example, a research mathematician might require only a few steps to prove a theorem to a colleague, but might take an hour to give an effective proof to a class of students. Therefore, what constitutes a proof often depends on the audience. But the audience is not the only factor. One of the most famous theorems in graph theory, <a data-knowl="./knowl/theorem-four-color-theorem.html" title="Theorem 9.6.15: The Four-Color Theorem">The Four-Color Theorem</a>, was proven in 1976, after over a century of effort by many mathematicians.  Part of the proof consisted of having a computer check many different graphs for a certain property. Without the aid of the computer, this checking would have taken years. In the eyes of some mathematicians, this proof was considered questionable. Shorter proofs have been developed since 1976 and there is no controversy associated with The Four Color Theorem at this time.</p>
