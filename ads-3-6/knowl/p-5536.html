<p>The last step was made possible by the fact that \(h_1*b=b*h_1\text{.}\) As the proof continued, we used the fact that \(h_1*h_2\) was in \(H\) and so \(a'*b'\) is \((a*b)*h\) for some \(h\) in \(H\text{.}\) All that we really needed in the “abelian step” was that \(h_1*b = b*(\textrm{something in } H) = b*h_3\text{.}\)  Then, since \(H\) is closed under \(G\)'s operation, \(h_3*h_2\) is an element of \(H\text{.}\) The consequence of this observation is that we define a certain kind of subgroup that guarantees that the inducted operation is well-defined.</p>
