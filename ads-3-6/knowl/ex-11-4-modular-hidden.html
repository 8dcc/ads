<li><p>We are all somewhat familiar with \(\mathbb{Z}_{12}\) since the hours of the day are counted using this group, except for the fact that 12 is used in place of 0.  Military time uses the mod 24 system and does begin at 0.  If someone started a four-hour trip at hour 21, the time at which she would arrive is \(21 +_{24} 4 = 1\text{.}\) If a satellite orbits the earth every four hours and starts its first orbit at hour 5, it would end its first orbit at time  \(5 +_{24}4 =9\text{.}\) Its tenth orbit would end at \(5 +_{24} 10\times_{24}4 =21\) hours on the clock</p></li>
<li><p>Virtually all computers represent unsigned integers in binary form with a fixed number of digits. A very small computer might reserve seven bits to store the value of an integer. There are only \(2^7\) different values that can be stored in seven bits. Since the smallest value is 0, represented as 0000000, the maximum value will be \(2^7 - 1 = 127\text{,}\) represented as 1111111. When a command is given to add two integer values, and the two values have a sum of 128 or more, overflow occurs. For example, if we try to add 56 and 95, the sum is an eight-digit binary integer 10010111. One common procedure is to retain the seven lowest-ordered digits. The result of adding 56 and 95 would be \(0010111_{\textrm{ two}} = 23 \equiv  56 + 95\pmod{128}\text{.}\) Integer arithmetic with this computer would actually be modulo 128 arithmetic.</p></li>
