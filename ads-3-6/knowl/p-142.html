<p>An initial choice of Mathematica for “source code” was based on the speed with which we could do the conversion.  However, the format was not ideal, with no viable web version available.  The project had been well-received in spite of these issues.  Validation through the listing of this project on the American Institute of Mathematics was very helpful. The current version of <em class="emphasis">Applied Discrete Structures</em> has been developed using <em class="emphasis">PreTeXt</em>, a lightweight XML application for authors of scientific articles, textbooks and monographs initiated by Rob Beezer, U. of Puget Sound.  When the PreTeXt project was launched, it was the natural next step.  The features of PreTeXt make it far more readable, with easy production of web, pdf and print formats.</p>
