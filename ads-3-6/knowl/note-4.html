<p>When a quantity, such as a savings account balance, is increased by some fixed percent, it is most easily computed with a multiplier. In the case of an \(8\%\) increase, the multiplier is 1.08 because any original amount \(A\text{,}\) has \(0.08A\) added to it, so that the new balance is \(A+0.08A = (1+0.08)A = 1.08 A\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Another example is that if the interest rate is \(3.5\%\text{,}\) the multiplier would be 1.035. This presumes that the interest is applied at the end of year for \(3.5\%\) annual interest, often called <dfn class="terminology">simple interest</dfn>. If the interest is applied monthly, and we assume a simplifed case where each month has the same length, the multiplier after every month would be \(\left(1+\frac{0.035}{12}\right) \approx  1.00292\text{.}\) After a year passes, this multiplier would be applied 12 times, which is the same as multiplying by \(1.00292^{12}\approx 1.03557\text{.}\) That increase from 1.035 to 1.03557 is the effect of <dfn class="terminology">compound interest</dfn>.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s-recurrence-relations.html#note-4">in-context</a></span>
