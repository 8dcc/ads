<body><article class="hiddenproof"><p>If you were to encounter this theorem outside the context of a discussion of mathematical induction, it might not be obvious that the proof can be done by induction. Recognizing when an induction proof is appropriate is mostly a matter of experience. Now on to the proof!</p>
<p>Basis:  Since 2 is a prime, it is already decomposed into primes (one of them).</p>
<p>Induction:  Suppose that for some \(n \geq  2\) all of the integers \(2,3, . . . , n\) have a prime decomposition.  Notice the course-of-value hypothesis.  Consider \(n + 1\text{.}\) Either \(n + 1\) is prime or it isn't.   If \(n + 1\) is prime, it is already decomposed into primes. If not, then \(n + 1\) has a divisor, \(d\text{,}\) other than 1 and \(n + 1\text{.}\) Hence, \(n + 1 = c d\) where both \(c\) and \(d\) are between 2 and \(n\text{.}\) By the induction hypothesis, \(c\) and \(d\) have prime decompositions, \(c_1 c_2 \cdots  c_s\) and \(d_1 d_2 \cdots d_t\) , respectively. Therefore, \(n + 1\) has the prime decomposition \(c_1 c_2 \cdots  c_s d_1 d_2 \cdots  d_t\text{.}\)</p></article></body>
