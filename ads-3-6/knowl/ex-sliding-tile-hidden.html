<body><article class="example-like"><p>Consider the sliding-tile puzzles pictured in <a data-knowl="./knowl/fig-sliding-tile.html" title="Figure 15.3.21">Figure 15.3.21</a>. Each numbered square is a tile and the dark square is a gap. Any tile that is adjacent to the gap can slide into the gap. In most versions of this puzzle, the tiles are locked into a frame so that they can be moved only in the manner described above. The object of the puzzle is to arrange the tiles as they appear in Configuration (a).  Configurations (b) and (c) are typical starting points. We propose to show why the puzzle can be solved starting with (b), but not with (c).</p>

<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span> <span class="codenumber">15.3.21.</span> Configurations of the sliding tile puzzle</figcaption></figure><p>We will associate a change in the configuration of the puzzle with an element of \(S_{16}\text{.}\) Imagine that a tile numbered 16 fills in the gap. For any configuration of the puzzle, the identity \(i\text{,}\) is the function that leave the configurate “as is.”   In general,  if \(f \in S_{16}\text{,}\) and \(1 \leq  k \leq  16\text{,}\) \(f(k)\) is the position to which  the tile in position \(k\) is moved by \(f\) that appears in the position of \(k\) in configuration (a). If we call the functions that, starting with configuration (a), result in configurations (b) and (c) by the names \(f_1\) and \(f_2\text{,}\) respectively,</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
f_1 = (1, 5, 3, 7)(2, 6, 4, 8)(9, 10)(11, 14, 13, 12)(15)(16)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>and</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
f_2 = (1, 5, 3, 7, 15)(2, 6, 4, 8)(9, 10)(11, 14, 13, 12)(16).
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>How can we interpret the movement of one tile as a permutation?  Consider what happens when the 12 tile of \(i\) slides into the gap. The result is a configuration that we would interpret as \((12,16)\text{,}\) a single transposition. Now if we slide the 8 tile into the 12 position, the result is or \((8, 16, 12)\text{.}\) Hence, by “exchanging” the tiles 8 and 16, we have implemented the function \((8, 12) (12, 16) = (8, 12, 16)\text{.}\)</p>

<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span> <span class="codenumber">15.3.22.</span> The configuration \((8, 12, 16)\)</figcaption></figure><p>Every time you slide a tile into the gap, the new permutation is a transposition composed with the old permutation. Now observe that to start with initial configuration and terminate after a finite number of moves with the gap in its original position, you must make an even number of moves. Thus, configuration corresponding any permutation that leaves 16 fixed  cannot be solved if the permutation is odd.  Note that \(f_2\) is an odd permutation; thus, Puzzle (c) can't be solved. The proof that all even permutations, such as  \(f_1\text{,}\) can be solved is left to the interested reader to pursue.</p></article></body>
