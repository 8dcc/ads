<p>There are several other situations for which this graph can serve as a model. One of them is to interpret the vertices as cities and the edges as roads, an abstraction of a map such as the one in <a data-knowl="./knowl/fig-undirected-2.html" title="Figure 9.1.11">Figure 9.1.11</a> . Another interpretation is as an abstraction of the floor plan of a house.  See <a data-knowl="./knowl/exercise-house-9-1.html" title="Exercise 9.1.5.11">Exercise 9.1.5.11</a>. Vertex \(a\) represents the outside of the house; all others represent rooms. Two vertices are connected if there is a door between them.</p>
