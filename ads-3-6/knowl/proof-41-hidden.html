<body><article class="hiddenproof"><p>Our proof consists of verifying that if the three properties above are true, then all the axioms of a group are true for \([H ; *]\text{.}\) By Condition (a), \(*\) can be considered an operation on \(H\text{.}\) The associative, identity, and inverse properties are the axioms that are needed. The identity and inverse properties are true by conditions (b) and (c), respectively, leaving only the associative property. Since, \([G; *]\) is a group, \(a * (b * c) = (a * b) * c\) for all \(a, b, c \in  G\text{.}\) Certainly, if this equation is true for all choices of three elements from \(G\text{,}\) it will be true for all choices of three elements from \(H\text{,}\) since \(H\) is a subset of \(G\text{.}\)</p></article></body>
