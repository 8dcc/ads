</h6>
<p>We will now consider the composition of permutations written in cyclic form by an example. Suppose that \(f
= (1,8, 3, 7)(4, 6)\) and \(g = (1, 5, 6)(8, 3, 7, 4)\) are elements of \(S_8\text{.}\) To calculate \(f\circ g\text{,}\) we start with simple concatenation:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{gather}
f \circ g = (1,8, 3, 7)(4, 6)(1,5,6)(8, 3, 7,4)\tag{15.3.1}
\end{gather}
</div>
<p>Although this is a valid expression for \(f \circ g\text{,}\) our goal is to express the composition as a product of disjoint cycles as \(f\) and \(g\) were individually written. We will start by determining the cycle that contains 1.  When combining any number of cycles, they are always read from right to left, as with all functions. The first cycle  in <a data-knowl="./knowl/equation-cycle-composition-1.html" title="Equation 15.3.1">(15.3.1)</a> does not contain 1; thus we move on to the second. The image of 1 under that cycle is 5. Now we move on to the next cycle, looking for 5, which doesn't appear. The fourth cycle does not contain a 5 either; so \(f\circ g(1) = 5\text{.}\)</p>
<p>At this point, we would have written “\(f \circ g = (1,5 \)” on paper. We repeat the steps to determine \(f\circ g(5)\text{.}\) This time the second cycle of <a data-knowl="./knowl/equation-cycle-composition-1.html" title="Equation 15.3.1">(15.3.1)</a> moves 5 to 6 and then the third cycle moves 6 to 4. Therefore, \(f\circ g(5) = 4\text{.}\) We continue until the cycle (1, 5, 4, 3) is completed by determining that \(f\circ g(3) = 1\text{.}\) The process is  then repeated starting with any number that does not appear in the cycle(s) that have already been completed.</p>
<p>The final result for our example is \(f \circ g = (1, 5, 4, 3)(6, 8, 7)\text{.}\) Since \(f(2) = 2\) and \(g(2) = 2\text{,}\) \(f\circ g(2) = 2\) and we need not include the one-cycle (2) in the final result, although it can be included.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s-permutation-groups.html#note-composing-permutations">in-context</a></span>
