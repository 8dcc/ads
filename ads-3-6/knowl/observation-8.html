<p>This last example changes our course of action. If we had gotten a factor group from \(\left\{C_0,C_1,C_2\right\}\text{,}\) we might have hoped to prove that every collection of left cosets forms a group. Now our question is: How can we determine whether we will get a factor group? Of course, this question is equivalent to: When is the induced operation well defined? There was only one step in the proof of <a data-knowl="./knowl/theorem-coset-operation-well-defined.html" title="Theorem 15.2.18: Coset operation is well-defined (Abelian Case)">Theorem 15.2.18</a>, where we used the fact that \(G\) was abelian. We repeat the equations here:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
a'*b' = \left(a*h_1\right)*\left(b*h_2 \right) = (a*b)*\left(h_1*h_2\right)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>since \(G\) was abelian.</p>
<p>The last step was made possible by the fact that \(h_1*b=b*h_1\text{.}\) As the proof continued, we used the fact that \(h_1*h_2\) was in \(H\) and so \(a'*b'\) is \((a*b)*h\) for some \(h\) in \(H\text{.}\) All that we really needed in the “abelian step” was that \(h_1*b = b*(\textrm{something in } H) = b*h_3\text{.}\)  Then, since \(H\) is closed under \(G\)'s operation, \(h_3*h_2\) is an element of \(H\text{.}\) The consequence of this observation is that we define a certain kind of subgroup that guarantees that the inducted operation is well-defined.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s-normal-subgroups-homomorphisms.html#observation-8">in-context</a></span>
