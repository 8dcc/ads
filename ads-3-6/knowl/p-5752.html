<p>As the example above illustrates, <a data-knowl="./knowl/theorem-basic-group-properties.html" title="Theorem 16.1.18: Some Basic Properties">TheoremÂ 16.1.18</a> is a modest beginning in the study of which algebraic manipulations are possible when working with rings. A fact in elementary algebra that is used frequently in problem solving is the cancellation law. We know that the cancellation laws are true under addition for any ring, based on group theory. Are the cancellation laws true under multiplication, where the group axioms can't be counted on? More specifically, let \([R; +, \cdot ]\) be a ring and let \(a, b, c\in R\) with \(a \neq 0\text{.}\) When can we cancel the \(a\)'s in the equation \(a \cdot  b = a \cdot  c\text{?}\) We can  do so if \(a^{-1}\) exists, but we cannot assume that \(a\) has a multiplicative inverse. The answer to this question is found with the following definition and the theorem that follows.</p>
