<p>Although the algebraic structures of rings and integral domains are widely used and play an important part in the applications of mathematics, we still cannot solve the simple equation \(a x = b\text{,}\) \(a \neq  0\) in all rings or  all integral domains, for that matter. Yet this is one of the first equations we learn to solve in elementary algebra and its solubility is basic to innumerable questions. If we wish to solve a wide range of problems in a system we need at least all of the laws true for rings and the cancellation laws together with the ability to solve the equation \(a x = b\text{,}\) \(a \neq  0\text{.}\) We summarize the above in a definition and list theorems  that will place this concept in the context of the previous section.</p>
