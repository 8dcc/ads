<p>The power of this theorem is that it can be applied to any algebraic system that \(M\) describes. Since \(B^*\) is one such system, we can apply <a data-knowl="./knowl/theorem-first-monoid.html" title="Theorem 11.2.1: A Monoid Theorem">TheoremÂ 11.2.1</a> to any two strings that commute. For example, 01 and 0101. Although a special case of this theorem could have been proven for \(B^*\text{,}\) it would not have been any easier to prove, and it would not have given us any insight into other special cases of \(M\text{.}\)</p>
