<p>The recognition and generation problems can vary in difficulty depending on how a language is defined and what sort of algorithms we allow ourselves to use. This is not to say that the means by which a language is defined determines whether it is recursive. It just means that the truth of the statement “\(L\) is recursive” may be more difficult to determine with one definition than with another. We will close this section with a discussion of grammars, which are standard forms of definition for a language. When we restrict ourselves to only certain types of algorithms, we can affect our ability to determine whether \(s\in L\) is true. In defining a recursive language, we do not restrict ourselves in any way in regard to the type of algorithm that will be used. In the next section, we will consider machines called finite automata, which can only perform simple algorithms.</p>
