<body><article class="example-like"><p>Union and intersection are both binary operations on the power set of any universe. Addition and multiplication are binary operators on the natural numbers. Addition and multiplication are binary operations on the set of 2 by 2 real matrices, \(M_{2\times 2}(\mathbb{R})\text{.}\)  Division is a binary operation on some sets of numbers, such as the positive reals. But on the integers (\(1/2\notin \mathbb{Z}\)) and even on the real numbers \((1/0\) is not defined), division is not a binary operation.</p></article></body>
