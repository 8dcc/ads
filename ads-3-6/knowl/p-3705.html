<p>The three traversals of an operation tree are all significant. A binary operation applied to a pair of numbers can be written in three ways. One is the familiar infix form, such as \(a + b\) for the sum of \(a\) and \(b\text{.}\) Another form is prefix, in which the same sum is written \(+a b\text{.}\) The final form is postfix, in which the sum is written \(a b+\text{.}\) Algebraic expressions involving the four standard arithmetic operations \((+,-,*, \text{and}
/)\) in prefix and postfix form are defined as follows:</p>
