<p>Although it is important to keep in mind that a sequence is a function, another useful way of visualizing a sequence is as a list. For example, the sequence \(A\) in the previous example could be written as \((0, 0, 2, 6, 12, 20, \dots )\text{.}\) Finite sequences can appear much the same way when they are the input to or output from a computer. The index of a sequence can be thought of as a time variable. Imagine the terms of a sequence flashing on a screen every second. Then \(s_k\) would be what you see in the \(k^{th}\) second. It is convenient to use terminology like this in describing sequences. For example, the terms that precede the \(k^{th}\) term of \(A\) would be \(A (0), A(1), . . . , A(k -1)\text{.}\)  They might be called the earlier terms.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s-Sequences.html#li-1294">in-context</a></span>
