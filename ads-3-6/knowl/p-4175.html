<p>A more conventional direct product is \(\mathbb{R}^2\text{,}\) the direct product of two factors of \([\mathbb{R}; + ]\text{.}\) The operation on \(\mathbb{R}^2\) is componentwise addition; hence we will use + as the operation symbol for this group. You should be familiar with this operation, since it is identical to addition of \(2 \times  1\) matrices. The Cartesian coordinate system can be used to visualize \(\mathbb{R}^2\) geometrically. We plot the pair \((s, t)\) on the plane in the usual way: \(s\) units along the \(x\) axis and \(t\) units along the \(y\) axis. There is a variety of different subgroups of \(\mathbb{R}^2\) , a few of which are:</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>\(\{(x, 0) \mid x \in  \mathbb{R}\}\text{,}\) all of the points on the \(x\) axis;</p></li>
<li><p>\(\{(x, y) \mid 2x- y = 0\}\text{,}\) all of the points that are on the line 2x - y = 0;</p></li>
<li><p>If \(a, b \in  \mathbb{R}\text{,}\) \(\{(x, y) \mid a x + b y = 0\}\text{.}\)  The first two subgroups are special cases of this one, which represents any line that passes through the origin.</p></li>
<li><p>\(\{(x, y) \mid 2x - y = k, k \in  \mathbb{Z}\}\text{,}\) a union of a set of lines that are parallel to \(2x - y = 0\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>\(\{(n, 3n) \mid n \in  \mathbb{Z}\}\text{,}\) which is the only countable subgroup that we have listed.</p></li>
</ol>
