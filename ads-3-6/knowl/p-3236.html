<p>Phase 1. If \(k = 0\text{,}\) start at any vertex, \(v_0\text{,}\) and travel along any path, not using any edge twice. Since each vertex has an even degree, this path can always be continued past each vertex that you reach except \(v_0\text{.}\) The result is a circuit that includes \(v_0\text{.}\) If \(k =2\text{,}\) let \(v_0\) be either one of the vertices of odd degree. Trace any path starting at \(v_0\) using up edges until you can go no further, as in the \(k = 0\) case. This time, the path that you obtain must end at the other vertex of odd degree that we will call \(v_1\text{.}\)  At the end of Phase 1, we have an initial path that may or may not be Eulerian. If it is not Eulerian, Phase 2 can be repeated until all of the edges have been used.  Since the number of unused edges is decreased in any use of Phase 2, an Eulerian path must be obtained in a finite number of steps.</p>
