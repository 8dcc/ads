In this chapter we will cover some of the basic set language and notation that will be used throughout the text. Venn diagrams will be introduced
in order to give the reader a clear picture of set operations. In addition, we will describe the binary representation of positive integers (Section
1.4) and introduce summation notation and its generalizations (Section 1.5).

<title>1.1 Set Notation and Relations </title>
<subsection>
<title>The notion of a set</title>
<p>The term set is intuitively understood by most people to mean a collection of objects that are called elements (of the set). This concept is the
starting point on which we will build more complex ideas, much as in-geometry where the concepts of point and line are left undefined. 
Because a set is such a simple notion, you may be surprised to learn that it is one of the most difficult concepts for mathematicians to define to
their own liking. For example, the description above is not a proper definition because it requires the definition of a collection. (How would you
define &quot;collection&quot;?) Even deeper problems arise when you consider the possibility that a set could contain itself. Although these problems
are of real concern to some mathematicians, they will not be of any concern to us. 
Our first concern will be how to describe a set; that is, how do we most conveniently describe a set and the elements that are in it? If we are going to discuss a set for any length of time, we usually give it a name in the form of a capital letter (or occasionally some other symbol). In discussing set <m> A</m>, if <m> x</m> is an element of <m> A</m>, then we will write <m>x \in  A</m>. On the other hand, if <m> x</m> is not an element
of <m> A</m>, we write <m>x \notin  A</m>. The most convenient way of describing the elements of a set will vary depending on the specific set. </p>
<p><em> Enumeration.</em> When the elements of a set are enumerated (or listed) it is traditional to enclose them in braces. For example, the
set of binary digits is<m>\{0, 1\}</m> and the set of decimal digits is <m>\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}</m>. The choice of a name for these sets would
be arbitrary; but it would be &quot;logical&quot; to call them <m> B</m> and <m> D</m> , respectively. The choice of a set name is much like the
choice of an identifier name in programming. Some large sets can be enumerated without actually listing all the elements. For example, the letters
of the alphabet and the integers from 1 to 100 could be described as 
<m>A = \{a, b, c,\ldots , x, y, z\}</m>, and <m>G = \{1, 2, \ldots  , 99, 100\}</m>. 
The three consecutive &quot;dots&quot; are called an ellipsis. We use them when it is clear what elements are included but not listed. An ellipsis is
used in two other situations. To enumerate the positive integers, we would write <m>\{1, 2, 3,\ldots  \}</m>, indicating that the list goes on infinitely.
If we want to list a more general set such as the integers between 1 and <m> n</m>, where <m> n</m> is some undetermined positive integer, we
might write <m>\{1,\ldots ,n\}</m>.
</p>   
<p><em> Standard Symbols</em>. Frequently used sets are usually given symbols that are reserved for them alone. For example, since we will be
referring to the positive integers throughout this book, we will use the symbol <m>\mathbb{P}</m> instead of writing <m>\{1, 2, 3, \ldots \}</m>. A few
of the other sets of numbers that we will use frequently are: 
<ul>
<li><m>\mathbb{N}</m> for the natural numbers, <m>\{0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots \}</m></li>
<li><m>mathbb{Z}</m> for the integers, <m>\{\ldots $, -3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,$\ldots \}</m></li>
<li>
<m>\mathbb{Q} for the rational numbers</m></li>
<li>
<m>\mathbb{R} for the real numbers</m></li>
<li>
<m>\mathbb{C} for the complex numbers}.</m></li>
</ul>
</p>	
<p>
<em> Set-Builder Notation</em>. Another way of describing sets is to use set-builder notation. For example, we could define the rational numbers
as <m>\mathbb{Q}=\{a/b : a, b \in  \mathbb{Z}, b\neq 0\}</m>
Note that in the set-builder description for the rational numbers: 
<ul><li> <m>a/b</m> indicates that a typical element of the set is a &quot;fraction.&quot; </li>
<li> The colon is read &quot;such that&quot; or &quot;where,&quot; and is used interchangeably with a vertical line, <m>|</m>. 
 </li>
<li> <m>a, b\in \mathbb{Z}</m> is an abbreviated way of saying <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are integers. 
 </li>
<li> All commas in mathematics are read as &quot;and.&quot; 
</li>
</ul>
The important fact to keep in mind in set notation, or in any mathematical notation, is that it is meant to be a help, not a hindrance. We hope that notation will assist us in a more complete understanding of the collection of objects under consideration and will enable us to describe it in a concise manner. However, brevity of notation is not the aim of sets. If you prefer to write <m>a\in \mathbb{Z}</m> and <m>b\in \mathbb{Z}</m> instead of <m>a, b\in \mathbb{Z}</m>, you should do so. Also, there are frequently many different, and equally good, ways of describing sets. For example, <m>\left\{x\in
\mathbb{R}\left| x^{2 }-5x+6\right.=0\right\}</m> and <m>\left\{x \left| x\in \mathbb{R}: x^{2 }-5x+6\right.=0\right\}</m> both describe the solution set<m>\{2, 3\}</m>. 
</p>
<p>A proper definition of the real numbers is beyond the scope of this text. It is sufficient to think of the real numbers as the set of points on a
number line. The complex numbers can be defined using set-builder notation as <m>\mathbb{C} = \{a + b i:a, b \in \mathbb{R}\}</m>, where <m>i^2 = -1</m>.  </p>
<p>
In the following definition we will leave the word &quot;finite&quot; undefined.   
</p>
<definition  id="finite-set.">
	<title> Finite Set.</title>
	<statement>A set is a finite set if it has a finite number of elements. Any set that is not finite is an infinite set.

<title> Cardinality.</title>
<statement>Let A be a finite set. The number of different elements in A is called its cardinality.
</statement>
<notation> <m>|A|</m></notation>
</definition>   
<p>As we will see later, there are different infinite cardinalities. We can't make this distinction now, so we will restrict cardinality to finite sets
until later.</p>

<li>(a)In [[refer to previous example]], <m>A = B</m>. Note that the ordering of the elements is unimportant. </li>
<li>The number of times that an element appears in an enumeration doesn't affect a set. For example, if <m>A = \{1, 5, 3, 5\}</m> and <m>B = \{1, 5, 3\}</m>, then <m>A = B</m>. Warning to readers of other texts: Some books introduce the concept of a multiset, in which the number of occurrences of an element matters.</li> 
</ol>
</example> 
<p>A few comments are in order about the expression &quot;if and only if&quot; as used in our definitions. This expression means &quot;is equivalent to saying,&quot;
or more exactly, that the word (or concept) being defined can at any time be replaced by the defining expression. Conversely, the expression that
defines the word (or concept) can be replaced by the word. </p>
<p>Occasionally there is need to discuss the set that contains no elements, namely the empty set, which is denoted by <m>\emptyset</m>.
This set is also called the null set.</p> 
<p>It is clear, we hope, from the definition of a subset, that given any set <m> A</m> we have <m>A\subseteq A</m> and <m>\emptyset \subseteq A</m>. Both
<m>\emptyset</m> and <m> A</m> are called <em>improper subsets </em>of <m>A</m>. If <m>B \subseteq  A</m>, <m>B\neq \emptyset</m>, and <m>B\neq A</m>,
then <m>B</m> is called a <em> proper subset</em> of <m>A</m>.</p>

<title>Set Operations and their Venn Diagams </title>

the sets by disks inside the rectangle.</p>

<title>1.3 Cartesian Products and Power Sets</title>
<definition  id="cartesian-product.">
<title> Cartesian Product.</title></definition> Let A and B be sets. The Cartesian product of A and B, denoted by <m>A\times B</m>, is defined as follows: <m>A\times
B = \{(a, b) | a \in  A\text\text{and} b \in  B\}</m>, that is, <m>A\times B</m> is the set of all possible ordered pairs whose first component comes
from A and whose second component comes from B. 
Example 1.3.1. Notation in mathematics is often developed for good reason. In this case, a few examples will make clear why the symbol
$\times $ is used for Cartesian products. 
(a) Let <m>A = \{1, 2, 3\}</m> and <m>B = \{4, 5\}</m>. Then <m>A \times  B = \{(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)\}</m>. Note that <m>|A \times
B| = 6\text= |A| \times  |B|</m>. 
(b) <m>A \times  A = \{(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)\}</m>. Note that <m>|A \times  A| = 9 = |A|^2</m>. 
These two examples illustrate the general rule: If A and B are finite sets, then <m>| A \times B | = 6\text= |A| \times  |B|</m>. 
We can define the Cartesian product of three (or more) sets similarly. For example, <m>A \times  B \times  C = \{(a, b, c):a \in  A, b \in  B, c \in
 C\}</m>. It is common to use exponents if the sets in a Cartesian product are the same: 
$\quad \quad \quad $<m>A^2=A \times  A</m> ,
$\quad \quad \quad $ <m>A^3=A \times A \times A\text</m>
$\quad \quad \quad \quad $<m>\ldots</m>
and in general, 
$\quad \quad \quad $<m>A^n = \left\{\left(a_1,\texta_2 ,\ldots  , a_n \right) :\text{each}\texta\in  A\right\}</m>.

<section id="1.4 Binary Representation of Positive Integers ">
<title>1.4 Binary Representation of Positive Integers </title>
<p>Recall that the set of positive integers, <m>\mathbb{P}</m>, is <m>\{1, 2, 3, . . . \}</m>. Positive integers are naturally used to count things. There
are many ways to count and many ways to record, or represent, the results of counting. For example, if we wanted to count five hundred twenty-three
apples, we might group the apples by tens. There would be fifty-two groups of ten with three single apples left over. The fifty-two groups of ten
could be put into five groups of ten tens (hundreds), with two tens left over. The five hundreds, two tens, and three units is recorded as 523. This
system of counting is called the base ten positional system, or decimal system. It is quite natural for us to do grouping by tens, hundreds, thousands,
. . . , since it is the method that all of us use in everyday life. 
The term positional refers to the fact that each digit in the decimal representation of a number has a significance based on its
position. Of course this means that rearranging digits will change the number being described. You may have learned of numeraton systems in which
the position of symbols does not have any significance (e.g., the ancient Egyptian system). Most of these systems are merely curiosities to us now.
</p>
<p>The binary number system differs from the decimal number system in that units are grouped by twos, fours, eights, etc. That is, the group sizes are
powers of two instead of powers of ten. For example, twenty-three can be grouped into eleven groups of two with one left over. The eleven twos can
be grouped into five groups of four with one group of two left over. Continuing along the same lines, we find that twenty-three can
be described as one sixteen, zero eights, one four, one two, and one one, which is abbreviated <m>10111_{\text{two}}</m>, or simply <m>10111</m> if the
context is clear. </p>
<p>The process that we used to determine the binary representation of <m>23</m> can be described in general terms to determine the binary representation
of any positive integer n. A general description of a process such as this one is called an algorithm. Since this is the first algorithm in the book,
we will first write it out using less formal language than usual, and then introduce some &quot;algorithmic notation.&quot;</p> 
<p>
<ol>
	<li> Start with an empty list of bits. </li>
	<li> Step Two: Assign the variable <m>k</m> the value <m>n</m>. </li>
	<li> Step Three: While <m>k</m>'s value is positive, continue doing the following three steps, and when <m>k</m> becomes zero, stop. </li>
	<ol> 
		<li>divide <m>k</m> by 2, obtaining a quotient <m>q</m> (often denoted <m>k \text{div} 2</m>) and a remainder <m>r</m> (denoted <m>(k \bmod 2)</m>). 
		<li>attach <m>r</m> to the left-hand</li>
side of the list of bits. </li>
		<li> assign the variable <m>k</m> the value of <m>q</m>.</li>   
	</ol>
</ol>
</p>
<example  id="example-1.4.1.">
<title> Example 1.4.1.</title>

 Determine the binary representation of 41.

<title>q</title></q> +r\text\longrightarrow  \text{add} r\text\text{to} \text{the} \text{list}</m>  
<m>41 = 2 \times  20+ 1</m> $\quad $List = 1 
<m>20 = 2 \times  10+0</m> $\quad $List = 01 
<m>10 = 2\times 5 + 0</m> $\quad $List = 001

<p>The notation that we will use to describe this algorithm and all others is called pseudocode, an informal variation of the instructions that are
commonly used in many computer languages. Read the following description carefully, comparing it with the informal
description above. Appendix B, which contains a general discussion of the components of the algorithms in this book, should clear up any lingering
questions. Anything after // are comments.</p>

<title>1.5 Summation Notation and Generalizations </title>
<p>Most operations such as addition of numbers are introduced as binary operations. That is, we are taught that two numbers may be added
together to give us a single number. Before long, we run into situations where more than two numbers are to be added. For example, if four numbers,
<m>a_1</m>, <m>a_2</m>, <m>a_3</m>, and <m>a_4</m> are to be added, their sum may be written down in several ways, such as<m></m> <m>\left(\left(a_1+a_2\right)+a_3\right)+a_4</m>
or <m>\left(a_1+a_2\right)+\left(a_3+a_4\right)</m>. In the first expression, the first two numbers are added, the result is added to the third number,
and that result is added to the fourth number. In the second expression the first two numbers and the last two numbers are added and the results
of these additions are added. Of course, we know that the final results will be the same. This is due to the fact that addition of numbers is an
associative operation. For such operations, there is no need to describe how more than two objects will be operated on. 
A sum of numbers such as <m>a_1+a_2+a_3+a_{4\text}</m>is called a series and is often written <m>\sum _{k=1}^4 a_k</m> in what is called <m> summation
notation</m>. </p>
<p>We first recall some basic facts about series that you probably have seen before. A more formal treatment of sequences and series is covered in Chapter
8. The purpose here is to give the reader a working knowledge of summation notation and to carry this notation through to intersection
and union of sets and other mathematical operations. </p>
A <m> finite series</m> is an expression such as <m>a_1+a_2+a_3 +\text{...} +a_{n\text}=\sum _{k=1}^n a_k</m> 
In the expression <m>\sum _{k=1}^n a_k</m>:
\item The variable <m>k</m> is referred to as the <m> index</m>, or the index of summation.
\item The expression <m>a_k</m> is the <m> general term</m> of the series. It defines the numbers that are being added together in the series.
\item The value of <m>k</m> below the summation symbol is the <m> initial index</m> and the value above the summation symbol is the <m> terminal
index</m>. 
\item It is understood that the series is a sum of the general terms where the index start with the initial index and increases by one up to and
including the terminal index.
<example  id="finite series">
<title>Some finite series</title>
<p>
(a)  <m>\sum _{i=1}^4 a_i= a_1+ a_2+a_3+a_4</m>
(b) <m>\sum _{k=0}^5 b_k=b_0+b_1+b_2+b_3+b_4+b_5</m>
(c) <m>\sum _{i=-2}^2 c_i=c_{-2}+c_{-1}+c_0+c_1+c_2</m>
</p>
</example>
<example  id="more finite series">
<title>More finite series </title>
<p>
If the general terms in a series are more specific, the sum can often be simplified. For example, 
(a)  <m>\sum _{i=1}^4 i^2=1^2+2^2+3^2+4^2=30</m>   
(b) <m>\sum _{i=1}^5 (2i-1)=(2\ 1-1)+(2\ 2-1)+(2\ 3-1)+(2\ 4-1)+(2\ 5-1)\\
\\
\quad \quad =1+3+5+7+9\\
\\
\quad \quad =25</m>
Summation notation can be generalized to many mathematical operations, for example, 
 $\quad \quad $<m>A_1\cap A_2\cap A_3\cap A_4=\underset{i=1}{\overset{4}{\cap }}A_i</m> 
</p>
</example>
<definition  id="generalized-set-operations">
<title> Generalized Set Operations.</title></definition> Let <m>A_1, A_2, \ldots , A_n</m> be sets, then: 
(1)   <m>A_1\cap A_2\cap \cdots \cap A_n=\underset{i=1}{\overset{n}{\cap }}A_i</m>
(2)   <m>A_1\cup A_2\cup \cdots \cup A_n=\underset{i=1}{\overset{n}{\cup }}A_i</m>
(3)   <m>A_1\times A_2\times \cdots \times A_n=\underset{i=1}{\overset{n}{\times }}A_i</m>
(4)   <m>A_1\oplus A_2\oplus \cdots \oplus A_n=\underset{i=1}{\overset{n}{\oplus }}A_i</m>

<example  id="example-1.5.3.">
<title>Some generalized operations</title>
<p>
If <m>A_1 = \{0, 2, 3\}</m>, <m>A_2 = \{1, 2, 3, 6\}</m>, and <m>A_3 = \{-1, 0, 3, 9\}</m>, then 
$\quad \quad \quad $<m>\underset{i=1}{\overset{4}{\cap }}A_i=A_1\cap A_2\cap A_3=\{3\}</m>
and
$\quad \quad \quad $<m>\underset{i=1}{\overset{4}{\cup }}A_i=A_1\cup A_2\cup A_3=\{-1,0,1,2,3,6,9\}</m>
With this notation it is quite easy to write lengthy expressions in a fairly compact form. For example, the statement 
    <m>A\cap \left(B_1\cup B_2\cup \cdots \cup B_n\right)= \left(A\cap B_1\right)\cup \left(A\cap B_2\right)\cup \cdots \cup \left(A\cap
B_n\right)</m>
becomes 
   <m>\text{        }A\cap \left(\underset{i=1}{\overset{n}{\cup }}B_i\right)= \underset{i=1}{\overset{n}{\cup }}\left(A\cap B_n\right)</m>

9.The symbol $\Pi $ is used for the product of numbers in the same way that $\Sigma $ is used for sums. For example,
  <m>\prod _{i=1}^5 x_i=x_1 x_2 x_3 x_4 x_5\text</m>
Evaluate the following: 
$\quad $(a) <m>\prod _{i=1}^3 i^2</m>
$\quad $(b)  <m>\prod _{i=1}^3 (2i+1)</m>
