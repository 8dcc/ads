Throughout this book we will be counting things. In this chapter we will outline some of the tools that will help us count.%
\par
Counting occurs not only in highly sophisticated applications of mathematics to engineering and computer science but also in many basic applications. Like many other powerful and useful tools in mathematics, the concepts are simple; we only have to recognize when and how they can be applied.

\typeout{************************************************}
\subsection[What is Combinatorics?]{What is Combinatorics?}\label{What-is-Combinatorics}

 One of the first concepts our parents taught us was the ``art of counting.'' We were taught to raise three fingers to indicate that we were three years old. The question of ``how many'' is a natural and frequently asked question. Combinatorics is the ``art of counting.'' It is the study of techniques that will help us to count the number of objects in a set quickly. Highly sophisticated results can be obtained with this simple concept. The following examples will illustrate that many questions concerned with counting involve the same process.
%
\begin{example}[How many lunches can you have?]\label{lunch-possibilies1}
A snack bar serves five different sandwiches and three different beverages. How many different lunches can a person order? One way of determining the number of possible lunches is by listing or enumerating all the possibilities. One systematic way of doing this is by means of a tree, as in the following figure.%
\leavevmode%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/lunch.png}
\caption{Tree diagram to enumerate the number of possible lunches.
                \label{lunch}}
\end{figure}
\par

 Every path that begins at the position labeled START and goes to the right can be interpreted as a choice of one of the five sandwiches followed by a choice of one of the three beverages. Note that considerable work is required to arrive at the number fifteen this way; but we also get more than just a number. The result is a complete list of all possible lunches. If we need to answer a question that starts with ``How many . . . ,'' enumeration would be done only as a last resort. In a later chapter we will examine more enumeration techniques.
%
\par

 An alternative method of solution for this example is to make the simple observation that there are five different choices for sandwiches and three different choices for beverages, so there are \(5 \cdot 3 = 15\) different lunches that can be ordered.
%
\par

 A listing of possible lunches a person could have is: \({(BEEF, milk), (BEEF, juice), (BEEF, coffee), ..., (BOLOGNA, coffee)}\).
%
\end{example}
\begin{example}[Counting elements in a cartesion product]\label{cartesian-cardinality}
Let \(A = \{a, b, c, d, e\}\) and \(B = \{1,2,3\}\). From Chapter 1 we know how to list the elements in \(A \times B = \{(a, 1), (a, 2), (a, 3), ..., (e, 3)\}\).  Since the first entry of each pair can be any one of the five elements \(a, b, c, d\), and \(e\), and since the second can be any one of the three numbers 1, 2, and 3, it is quite clear there are 
\(5 \cdot 3 = 15\) different elements in \(A \times B\).
%
\end{example}
\begin{example}[A True-False Questionnaire]\label{questionnaire}
A person is to complete a true-false questionnaire consisting of ten questions. How many different ways are there to answer the questionnaire? Since each question can be answered either of two ways (true or false), and there are a total of ten questions, there are \begin{equation*} 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 2^{10} = 1024\end{equation*} different ways of answering the questionnaire. The reader is encouraged to visualize the tree diagram of this example, but not to draw it!%
\end{example}
\par

 We formalize the procedures developed in the previous examples with the following rule and its extension.
%
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Subsection 1.1.2 The Rule Of Products:}
\typeout{************************************************}
\subsection[The Rule Of Products:]{The Rule Of Products:}\label{rule-of-products}
\index{The Rule Of Products:}If two operations must be performed, and If the first operation can always be performed \(p_1\) different ways and the second operation can always be performed \(p_2\) different ways, then there are \(p_1 p_2\) different ways that the two operations can be performed.
%
\par

Note: It is important that \(p_2\) does not depend on the option that is chosen in the first operation. Another way of saying this is that \(p_2\) is independent of the first operation. If \(p_2\) is dependent on the first operation, then the rule of products does not apply.
%
\begin{example}[Reduced Lunch Possibilities]\label{lunch-possibilites2}
Assume in \hyperref[lunch-possibilies1]{\ref{lunch-possibilies1}}, coffee is not served with a beef or chicken sandwiches. Then by inspection of \hyperref[lunch]{\ref{lunch}} we see that there are only thirteen different choices for lunch. The rule of products does not apply, since the choice of beverage depends on one's choice of a sandwich.%
\end{example}
\par
\emph{Extended Rule Of Products.} The rule of products can be extended to include sequences of more than two operations. If \(n\) operations must be performed, and the number of options for each operation is \(p_1\), \(p_2, \dots, p_n\) respectively, with each \(p_i\)  independent of previous choices, then the \(n\) operations can be performed \(p_1 \cdot p_2 \cdot \cdots \cdot p_n\) different ways.
%
\begin{example}[A Multiple Choice Questionnaire]\label{another_questionnaire}
A questionnaire contains four questions that have two possible answers and three questions with five possible answers. Since the answer to each question is independent of the answers to the other questions, the extended rule of products applies and there are
\(2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 = 2^4 \cdot 5^3 = 2000 \) different ways to answer the questionnaire.%
\end{example}
\par

 In Chapter 1 we introduced the power set of a set A, P(A), which is the set of all subsets of A. Can we predict how many elements are in \(\mathcal{P}(A)\) for a given finite set A? The answer is yes, and in fact if \(\lvert A \rvert  = n\), then \(\mathcal{P}(A) = 2^{n}\).  The ease with which we can prove this fact demonstrates the power and usefulness of the rule of products. Do not underestimate the usefulness of simple ideas.
%
\begin{theorem}[Power Set Cardinality Theorem]\label{power-set-cardinality-theorem}
\index{Power Set Cardinality Theorem}If \(A\) is a finite set, then \(\lvert \mathcal{P}(A) \rvert = 2^{\lvert A \rvert }\).%
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}\hypertarget{proof-1}{}

Proof: Consider how we might determine any \(B \in \mathcal{P}(A)\), where \( \lvert A \rvert =n\). For each element \(x \in A\) there are two choices, either \(x \in B\) or \(x \notin B\).  Since there are \(n\)  elements of \(A\)  we have, by the rule of products, 
  \begin{equation*}\underset{n \textrm{ factors}}{\underline{2 \cdot 2 \cdot  \cdots \cdot 2}}=  2^n\end{equation*}   different subsets of \(A\). Therefore, \(\mathcal{P}(A)= 2^{n}\).

\section[Permutations]{Permutations}\label{permutations}

 A number of applications of the rule of products are of a specific type, and because of their frequent appearance they are given their own designation, permutations. Consider the following examples.
%
\begin{example}[Ordering the elements of a set]\label{ordering_a_set}
How many different ways can we order the three different elements of the set \(A = \{a, b, c\}\)? Since we have three choices for position one, two choices for position two, and one choice for the third position, we have, by the rule of products, \(3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 6\) different ways of ordering the three letters. We illustrate through a tree diagram.%
\leavevmode%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/tree-of-permutations.png}
\caption{A tree to enumerate permutations of a three element set.
                \label{tree-of-permutations}}
\end{figure}
\par

 Each of the six orderings is called a permutation of the set A.
%
\end{example}
\begin{example}[Ordering a schedule]\label{ordering_a_schedule}
A student is taking five courses in the fall semester. How many different ways can the five courses be listed? There are \(5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 120\) different permutations of the set of courses.%
\end{example}
\par
In each of the above examples of the rule of products we observe that:%
\par
\leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}
\item\hypertarget{li-14}{}We are asked to order or arrange elements from a single set.%
\item\hypertarget{li-15}{}Each element is listed exactly once in each list (permutation). So if there are \(n\) choices for position one in a list, there are \(n - 1\) choices for position two, \(n - 2\) choices for position three, etc.%
\end{enumerate}
%
\begin{example}[Some orderings of a baseball team]\label{some_orderings_of_a_baseball_team}
The alphabetical ordering of the players of a baseball team is one permutation of the set of players. Other orderings of the players' names might be done by batting average, age, or height. The information that determines the ordering is called the key. We would expect that each key would give a different permutation of the names. If there are twenty-five players on the team, there are \(25 \cdot 24 \cdot 23 \cdot \cdots  \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1\) different permutations of the players.%
\par
This number of permutations is huge. In fact it is 15511210043330985984000000, but writing it like this isn't all that instructive, while leaving it as a product as we originally had makes it easier to see where the number comes from.  We just need to find a more compact way of writing these products.%
\end{example}
\par

 We now develop notation that will be useful for permutation problems.
%
\begin{definition}[Factorial]\label{Definition-Factorial.}
\index{Factorial}\label{notation-1}
If \(n\) is a positive integer then \(n\) factorial is the product of the first \(n\) positive integers and is denoted \(n!\). Additionally, we define zero factorial, \(0!\) to be 1.%
\end{definition}
\par
The first few factorials are 
\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{ccccccccc}
 n & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 &
   7 \\
  n! & 1 & 1 & 2 & 6 & 24 & 120 &
   720 & 5040 \\
\end{array}
\end{equation*}%
\par
Note that \(4!\) is 4 times \(3!\), or 24, and \(5!\) is 5 times \(4!\), or 120. In addition, note that as n grows in size, \(n!\) grows extremely quickly. For example, \(11! = 39916800\). If the answer to a problem happens to be \(25!\), as in the previous example, you would never be expected to write that number out completely. However, a problem with an answer of \(\frac{25!}{23!}\) can be reduced to \(25 \cdot 24\), or 600.%
\par

 If \(\lvert A \rvert = n \), there are \(n!\) ways of permuting all \(n\)  elements of \(A\) . We next consider the more general situation where we would like to permute \(k\) elements  out of a set of \(n\)  objects, where \( k \leq n\).
%
\begin{example}[Choosing Club Officers]\label{choosing-club-officers}
A club of twenty-five members will hold an election for president, secretary, and treasurer in that order. Assume a person can hold only one position. How many ways are there of choosing these three officers? By the rule of products there are \(25 \cdot 24 \cdot 23\) ways of making a selection.%
\end{example}
\begin{definition}[Permutation]\label{permutation}
\index{Permutation} An ordered arrangement of \(k\) elements selected from a set of \(n\) elements, \(0 \leq k \leq  n\), where no two elements of the arrangement are the same, is called a permutation of \(n\) objects taken \(k\) at a time. The total number of such permutations is denoted by \(P(n, k)\).%
\end{definition}
\begin{theorem}[Permutation Counting Formula]\label{permutations-counting-formula}
\index{Permutation Counting Formula} The number of possible permutations of \(k\)  elements taken from a set of \(n\)  elements is
 \begin{equation*}P(n,k)=n \cdot (n-1) \cdot (n-2) \cdot  \cdots  \cdot (n-k+1) = \prod_{j=0}^{k-1} (n-j) = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!} \end{equation*}%
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}\hypertarget{proof-2}{}
  Case I: If \(k = m\) we have \(P(n,n)=n!=\frac{n!}{(n-n)!}\). %
\par
 Case II: If \(0 \leq  k < n\),then we have \(k\)  positions to fill using \(n\) elements and%
\par
\leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}
\item\hypertarget{li-16}{}
 Position 1 can be filled by any one of \(n-0=n\)  elements
%
\item\hypertarget{li-17}{}
 Position 2 can be filled by any one of \(n-1\)  elements
%
\item\hypertarget{li-18}{}\( \cdots \)%
\item\hypertarget{li-19}{}
 Position k can be filled by any one of \(n-(k-1)=n-k+1\)  elements
%
\end{enumerate}
%
\par
Hence, by the rule of products, \begin{equation*}P(n,k) = n \cdot(n - 1) \cdot (n - 2) \cdot \cdots \cdot (n - k + 1) = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}\end{equation*}. %
\end{proof}
\par

 It is important to note that the derivation of the permutation formula given above was done solely through the rule of products. This serves to reiterate our introductory remarks in this section that permutation problems are really rule-of-products problems.  We close this section with several examples.
%
\begin{example}[Another example of choosing officers]\label{more_club_officers}
A club has eight members eligible to serve as president, vice-president, and treasurer. How many ways are there of choosing these officers?
%
\par

 Solution 1: Using the rule of products. There are eight possible choices for the presidency, seven for the vice-presidency, and six for the office of treasurer. By the rule of products there are \(8 \cdot 7\cdot 6 = 336\) ways of choosing these officers.
%
\par

 Solution 2: Using the permutation formula. We want the total number of permutations of eight objects taken three at a time:
 	\begin{equation*}P(8,3)=\frac{8!}{(8-3)!}=8 \cdot 7 \cdot 6 = 336\end{equation*}
%
\end{example}
\begin{example}[Course ordering, revisited]\label{course-ordering-revisited}
To count the number of ways to order five courses, we can use the permutation formula. We want the number of permutations of five courses taken five at a time:
\begin{equation*}P(5,5)= \frac{5!}{(5-5)!}= 5!= 120\end{equation*}%
\end{example}
\begin{example}[Ordering of digits under different conditions]\label{ordering-digits}
Consider only the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.%
\par
\leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*]
\item\hypertarget{li-20}{} How many three-digit numbers can be formed if no repetition of digits can occur?%
\item\hypertarget{li-21}{} How many three-digit numbers can be formed if repetition of digits is allowed?%
\item\hypertarget{li-22}{} How many three-digit numbers can be formed if only non-consecutive repetition of digits are allowed?%
\end{enumerate}
%
\par

 Solutions to (a): Solution 1: Using the rule of products. We have any one of five choices for digit one, any one of four choices for digit two, and three choices for digit three. Hence, \(5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 = 60\) different three-digit numbers can be formed.
%
\par
Solution 2; Using the permutation formula. We want the total number of permutations of five digits taken three at a time:
 \begin{equation*}P(5,3)=\frac{5!}{(5-3)!}=5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 = 60\end{equation*}%
\par
Solution to (b): The definition of permutation indicates `` ...no two elements in each list are the same.'' Hence the permutation formula cannot be used. However, the rule of products still applies. We have any one of five choices for the first digit, five choices for the second, and five for the third. So there are \(5 \cdot 5\cdot 5 = 125\) possible different three-digit numbers if repetition is allowed.%
\par
Solution to (c): Again, the rule of products applies here. We have any one of five choices for the first digit, but then for the next two digits we have four choices since we are not allowed to repeat the previous digit  So there are \(5 \cdot 4\cdot 4 = 80\) possible different three-digit numbers if only non-consecutive repetitions are allowed.%

\section[Partitions of Sets and the Law of Addition]{Partitions of Sets and the Law of Addition}\label{Partitions-and-Law-of-Addition}

 One way of counting the number of students in your class would be to count the number in each row and to add these totals. Of course this problem is simple because there are no duplications, no person is sitting in two different rows. The basic counting technique that you used involves an extremely important first step, namely that of partitioning a set. The concept of a partition must be clearly understood before we proceed further.
%
\begin{definition}[Partition.]\label{partition}
\index{Partition.} A partition of set \(A\) is a set of one or more nonempty subsets of \(A\): \(A_1, A_2, A_3, \cdots\), such that every element of \(A\) is in exactly one set.  Symbolically, %
\par
\leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*]
\item\hypertarget{li-39}{}\(A_1 \cup A_2 \cup A_3 \cup \cdots = A\)%
\item\hypertarget{li-40}{}If  \(i \neq j\) then \(A_i \cap A_j = \emptyset\)%
\end{enumerate}
%
\end{definition}
\par

 The subsets in a partition are often referred to as blocks. Note how our definition allows us to partition infinite sets, and to partition a set into an infinite number of subsets. Of course, if \(A\)  is finite the number of subsets can be no larger than \(\lvert A \rvert \).
%
\begin{example}[Some partitions of a four element set]\label{some-partitions-4}

  Let \(A = \{a, b, c, d\}\). Examples of partitions of \(A\)  are:%
\par
\leavevmode%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{} \(\{\{a\}, \{b\}, \{c, d\}\}\)%
\item{} \(\{\{a, b\}, \{c, d\}\}\)%
\item{} \(\{\{a\}, \{b\}, \{c\}, \{d\}\}\)%
\end{itemize}
%
\par
How many others are there, do you suppose?
%
\par
There are 15 different partitions.  The most efficient way to count them all is to classify them by the size of blocks.   For example, the partition \(\{\{a\}, \{b\}, \{c, d\}\}\) has block sizes 1, 1, and 2.
%
\end{example}
\begin{example}[Some Integer Partitions]\label{some-integer-partitions}
Two examples of partitions of set of integers \(\mathbb{Z}\) are %
\par
\leavevmode%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}\(\{\{n\} \mid n \in \mathbb{Z}\}\) and%
\item{} \(\{\{ n \in \mathbb{Z} \mid n < 0\}, \{0\},\{ n \in \mathbb{Z} \mid 0 < 0 \}\}\).%
\end{itemize}
%
\par
 The set of subsets \(\{\{n \in \mathbb{Z} \mid n \geq 0\},\{n \in \mathbb{Z} \mid  n \leq 0\}\}\) is not a partition because the two subsets have a nonempty intersection. A second example of a non-partition is 
\(\{\{n \in \mathbb{Z} \mid  \lvert n \rvert = k\} \mid k = -1, 0, 1, 2, \cdots\}\) because one of the blocks, when \(k=-1\) is empty.%
\end{example}
\par
One could also think of the concept of partitioning a set as a ``packaging problem.'' How can one ``package'' a carton of, say, twenty-four cans? We could use: four six-packs, three eight-packs, two twelve-packs, etc. In all cases: (a) the sum of all cans in all packs must be twenty-four, and (b) a can must be in one and only one pack.
%
\begin{theorem}[The Basic Law Of Addition:]\label{basic-law-addition}
\index{Basic Law Of Addition:}If \(A\) is a finite set, and if \(\{A_1,A_2,\ldots ,A_n\}\) is a partition of \(A\) , then 
\begin{equation*}\lvert A \rvert = \lvert A_1 \rvert + \lvert A_2 \rvert + \cdots + \lvert A_n \rvert = \sum_{k=1}^n  \lvert A_k \rvert\end{equation*}
%
\end{theorem}
\par

 The basic law of addition can be rephrased as follows: If \(A\)  is a finite set where \(A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \cdots \cup A_n = A\) and where \(A_i \cap A_j\) whenever \(i \neq j\), then
 \begin{equation*}\lvert A \rvert = \lvert A_1 \cup A_2 \cup  \cdots \cup A_n  \rvert = \lvert A_1 \rvert + \lvert A_2 \rvert + \cdots + \lvert A_n \rvert \end{equation*}
%
\begin{example}[Counting All Students]\label{counting-all-students}
The number of students in a class could be determined by adding the numbers of students who are freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors, and those who belong to none of these categories. However, you probably couldn't add the students by major, since some students may have double majors.
%
\end{example}
\begin{example}[Counting Students in Disjoint Classes]\label{student-counting-disjoint}
The sophomore computer science majors were told they must take one and only one of the following courses, Cryptography, Data Structures, or Javascript, in a given semester. The numbers in each course, respectively, for sophomore CS majors, were 75, 60, 55. How many sophomore C.S. majors are there? The Law of Addition applies here. There are exactly \(75 + 60 + 55 = 190\) CS majors since the rosters of the three courses listed above would be a partition of the CS majors.%
\end{example}
\begin{example}[Counting Students in Non-disjoint Classes]\label{student-counting-nondisjoint}
It was determined that all junior computer science majors take at least one of the following courses: Algorithms, Logic Design, and Compiler Construction. Assume the number in each course was was 75, 60 and 55, respectively for the three courses listed. Further investigation indicated ten juniors took all three courses, twenty-five took  Algorithms and Logic Design, twelve took Algorithms and Compiler Construction, and fifteen took Logic Design and Compiler Construction. How many junior C.S. majors are there?
%
\par
\hyperref[student-counting-disjoint]{\ref{student-counting-disjoint}} was a simple application of the law of addition, however in this example some students are taking two or more courses, so a simple application of the law of addition would lead to double or triple counting. We rephrase information in the language of sets to describe the situation more explicitly.
%
\par

 \(A\) = the set of all junior computer science majors
%
\par

  \(A_1\) = the set of all junior computer science majors who took Algorithms
%
\par

  \(A_2\) = the set of all junior computer science majors who took Logic Design
%
\par

  \(A_3\) = the set of all junior computer science majors who took Compiler Construction
%
\par

 Since all sophomore CS majors must take at least one of the courses, the number we want is:
 \begin{equation*}\lvert A \rvert = \lvert A_1 \cup A_2 \cup A_3 \rvert = \lvert A_1 \rvert + \lvert A_2 \rvert + \lvert A_3 \rvert - \textrm{repeats}.\end{equation*}
%
\par

 A Venn diagram is helpful to visualize the problem. In this case the universal set \(U\)  can stand for 	all students in the university.
%
\leavevmode%
\begin{figure}

\IfFileExists{images/sageplot-venn-CS_Students.pdf}%

{\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/sageplot-venn-CS_Students.png}}
\caption{Venn Diagram\label{venn_diagram_CS_Students}}
\end{figure}
\par

 We see that the whole universal set is naturally partitioned into subsets that are labeled by the numbers 1 through 8, and the set \(A\)  is  partitioned into subsets labeled 1 through 7. The region labeled 8 represents all students who are not junior CS majors.  Note also that students in the subsets labeled 2, 3, and 4 are double counted, and those in the subset labeled 1 are triple counted. To adjust, we must subtract the numbers in regions 2, 3 and 4.  This can be done by subtracting the numbers in the intersections of each pair of sets.  However, the individuals in region 1 will have been removed three times, just as they had been originally added three times.  Therefore, we must finally add their number back in.
%
\par
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
 \lvert A \rvert & =  \lvert A_1 \cup A_2 \cup A_3 \rvert \\ 
 & = \lvert A_1 \rvert + \lvert A_2 \rvert + \lvert A_3 \rvert - \textrm{repeats} \\
 & = \lvert A_1 \rvert + \lvert A_2 \rvert + \lvert A_3 \rvert - \textrm{duplicates} + \textrm{triplicates}  \\
 & = \lvert A_1 \rvert + \lvert A_2 \rvert + \lvert A_3 \rvert - \left(\lvert A_1 \cap A_2 \rvert + \lvert A_1 \cap A_3 \rvert+ \lvert A_2 \cap A_3 \rvert \right) + \lvert A_1 \cap A_2 \cap A_3 \rvert  \\
 & = 75 + 60 + 55 - 25 - 12 - 15 + 10 = 148 
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
%
\end{example}
\par

The ideas used in this latest example gives rise to a basic counting technique:
%
\begin{theorem}[Laws of Inclusion-Exclusion]\label{inclusion-exclusion}
\index{Inclusion-Exclusion, Laws of }Given finite sets \(A_1, A_2, A_3\), then%
\par
\leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}
\item\hypertarget{ie2}{}\begin{equation*} \lvert A_1 \cup A_2 \rvert =\lvert A_1 \rvert + \lvert A_2 \rvert - \lvert A_1 \cap A_2 \rvert  \end{equation*}%
\item\hypertarget{ie3}{}
\begin{equation*} 
\begin{split}
 \lvert A_1 \cup A_2 \cup A_3 \rvert & =\lvert A_1 \rvert + \lvert A_2 \rvert + \lvert A_3 \rvert\\
&\quad - (\lvert A_1 \cap A_2 \rvert + \lvert A_1 \cap A_3 \rvert+ \lvert A_2 \cap A_3 \rvert)\\
&\quad + \lvert A_1 \cap A_2 \cap A_3 \rvert
\end{split} 
\end{equation*}%
\end{enumerate}
%
\end{theorem}
\par
The inclusion-exclusion laws extend to more than three sets, as will be explored in the exercises.%
\par
In this section we saw that being able to partition a set into disjoint subsets gives rise to a handy counting technique. Given a set, there are many ways to partition depending on what one would wish to accomplish. One natural partitioning of sets is apparent when one draws a Venn diagram. This particular partitioning of a set will be discussed further in Chapters 4 and 13.

\subsection[Combinations]{Combinations}\label{combinations}
\index{Combinations} In Section 2.1 we investigated the most basic concept in combinatorics, namely, the rule of products. Even though in this section we investigate other counting formulas, it is of paramount importance to keep this fundamental process in mind. In Section 2.2 we saw that a subclass of rule-of-products problems appears so frequently that we gave them a special designation, namely, permutations, and we derived a formula as a computational aid to assist us. In this section we will investigate another counting formula that are used to count combinations, which are subsets of a certain size..%
\par
In many rule-of-products applications the permutation or order is important, as in the situation of the order of putting on one's socks and shoes; in some cases it is not important, as in placing coins in a vending machine or in the listing of the elements of a set. Order is important in permutations. Order is not important in combinations.%
\begin{example}[Counting Permutations]\label{counting-permuations-multiple-ways}
How many different ways are there to permute three letters from the set \(A = \{a, b, c, d\}\)?  From the \hyperref[permutations-counting-formula]{Permutation Counting Formula} there are \(P(4,3)=\frac{4!}{(4-3)!} = 24\) different orderings of three letters from \(A\) %
\end{example}
\begin{example}[Counting with No Order]\label{four-choose-three}
How many ways can we select a set of three letters from  \(A = \{a, b, c, d\}\)?  Note here that we are not concerned with the order of the three letters. By trial and error, abc, abd, acd, and bcd are the only listings possible. To repeat, we were looking for all three-element subsets of the set A. Order is not important in sets. The notation for choosing 3 elements from 4 is most commonly \(\binom{4}{3}\) or occasionally \(C(4,3)\), either of which is read ``4 choose 3'' or the number of combinations for four objects taken three at a time.%
\end{example}
\begin{definition}[Binomial Coefficient]\label{binomial-coefficient}
\index{Binomial Coefficient}\label{notation-2}
Let \(n\) and \(k\) be nonnegative integers.  The binomial coefficient \(\binom{n}{k}\) represents the number of combinations of \(n\) objects taken \(k\) at a time, and is read ``\(n\) choose \(k\).''%
\end{definition}
\par
We would now like to investigate the relationship between permutation and combination problems in order to derive a formula for \(\binom{n}{k}\)%
\par
Let us reconsider the \hyperref[four-choose-three]{Counting with No Order}. There are \(3 ! = 6\) different orderings for each of the three-element subsets. The table below lists each subset of \(A\)  and all permutations of each subset on the same line.
\begin{equation*}
 \begin{array}{cc}
 \textrm{subset} & \textrm{permutations} \\
 abc & abc,acb,bca,bac,cab,cba \\
 abd & abd,adb,bda,bad,dab,dba \\
 acd & acd,adc,cda,cad,dac,dca \\
 bcd & bcd,bdc,cdb,cbd,dbc,dcb \\
\end{array}
 \end{equation*}%
\par
 Hence, \(\binom{4}{3} = \frac{P(4,3)}{3!} = \frac{4!}{(4-3)! \cdot 3!} = 4\)%
\par
 We generalize this result in the following theorem:%
\begin{theorem}[Binomial Coefficient Formula]\label{binomial-coefficient-formula}
\index{Binomial Coefficient Formula}If \(n\) and \(k\) are nonnegative integers with \(0 \leq k \leq n\), then the number \(k\)-element subsets of an \(n\) element set is equal to \begin{equation*}\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{(n-k)! \cdot k!} \end{equation*}%
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}\hypertarget{proof-3}{}
Proof 1: There are \(k!\) ways of ordering the elements of any \(k\) element set.Therefore,
\begin{equation*}\binom{n}{k} = \frac{P(n,k)}{k!} = \frac{n!}{(n-k)! k!}.\end{equation*}%
\par
Proof 2: To ``construct'' a permutation of \(k\)  objects from a set of \(n\) elements, we can first choose one of the subsets of objects and second, choose one of the \(k!\)  permutations of those objects. By the rule of products,\begin{equation*}P(n,k) = \binom{n}{k} \cdot k!\end{equation*} and solving for \(\binom{n}{k}\) we get the desired formula.%
\end{proof}
\begin{example}[Flipping Coins]\label{flipping-coins}
  Assume an evenly balanced coin is tossed five times. In how many ways can three heads be obtained? This is a combination problem, because the order in which the heads appear does not matter. The number of ways to get three heads is \(\binom{5}{3}= \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10\).
%
\end{example}
\begin{example}[Listing Five Flips, taking order into account]\label{five-flips}
Determine the total number of ways a fair coin can land if tossed five consecutive times. The five tosses can produce any one of the following mutually exclusive, disjoint events: 5 heads, 4 heads, 3 heads, 2 heads, 1 head, or 0 heads. Hence by the law of addition we have:
\begin{equation*}\binom{5}{5}+\binom{5}{4}+\binom{5}{3}+\binom{5}{2}+\binom{5}{1}+\binom{5}{0}= 1 + 5 +10+10+5+1 = 32\end{equation*} ways to observe the five flips%
\par
 Of course, we could also have applied the extended rule of products, and since there are two possible outcomes for each of the five tosses, we have \(2^5 = 32\) ways.%
\end{example}
\par
You might think that counting something two ways is a waste of time but solving a problem two different ways often is instructive and leads to valuable insights. In this case, it suggests a general formula for the sum 
\(\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k}\). In the case of \(n = 5\), we get \(2^5\) so it is reasonable to expect that the general sum is \(2^n\), and it is.%
\begin{example}[A Committee of Five]\label{committee-of-five}
A committee usually starts as an unstructured set of people selected from a larger membership. Therefore, a committee can be thought of as a combination. If a club of 25 members has a five-member social committee, there are \(\binom{25}{5}=\frac{25 24 23 22 21}{5!} = 53130\) different possible social committees. If any structure or restriction is placed on the way the social committee is to be selected, the number of possible committees will probably change. For example, if the club has a rule that the treasurer must be on the social committee, then the number of possibilities is reduced to \(\binom{24}{4}=\frac{24 23 22 21}{4!} = 10626\). %
\par
 If we further require that a chairperson other than the treasurer be selected for the social committee, we have  \(\binom{24}{4} \cdot 4 = 42504\) different possible social committees. The choice of the four non-treasurers accounts for the factor \(\binom{24}{4}\) while the need to choose a chairperson accounts for the 4.%
\end{example}
\begin{example}[Binomial Coefficients - Extreme Cases]\label{extreme-binomial-cases}
By simply applying the definition of a \hyperref[binomial-coefficient]{Binomial Coefficient} as a number of subsets we see that there is \(\binom{n}{0} = 1\) way of choosing a combination of zero elements from a set of \(n\). In addition, we see that   there is \(\binom{n}{n} = 1\) way of choosing a combination of \(n\) elements from a set of \(n\). %
\par
We could compute these values using the formula we have developed, but no arithmetic is really needed here.  Other properties of binomial coefficients that can be derived using the subset definition will be seen in the exercises%
\end{example}

\subsection[The Binomial Theorem]{The Binomial Theorem}\label{the-binomial-theorem}

 The binomial theorem gives us a formula for expanding \(( x + y )^{n}\), where \(n\)  is a nonnegative integer. The coefficients of this expansion are precisely the binomial coefficients that we have used to count combinations. Using high school algebra we can  expand the expression for integers from 0 to 5:%
\par
\begin{equation*} \begin{array}{cc}
 n & (x + y)^n \\
 0 & 1 \\
 1 & x+y \\
 2 & x^2+2 x y+y^2 \\
 3 & x^3+3 x^2 y+3 x y^2+y^3 \\
 4 & x^4+4 x^3 y+6 x^2 y^2+4 x y^3+y^4
   \\
 5 & x^5+5 x^4 y+10 x^3 y^2+10 x^2
   y^3+5 x y^4+y^5 \\
\end{array}
 \end{equation*}
 %
\par
In the expansion of \((x + y)^{5} \)  we note that the coefficient of the third term is \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\), and that of the sixth term is  \(\binom{5}{5}=1\). We can rewrite the expansion as 
\begin{equation*}\binom{5}{0} x^5+\binom{5}{1} x^4 y+\binom{5}{2} x^3 y^2+\binom{5}{3} x^2 y^3+\binom{5}{4} x y^4+ \binom{5}{5} y^5
\end{equation*}%
\par

 In summary, in the expansion of \(( x + y )^{n}\) we note:%
\par
\leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}
\item\hypertarget{li-59}{}The first term is \(x^n\) and the last term is \(y^n\). %
\item\hypertarget{li-60}{} With each successive term, exponents of \(x\) decrease by 1 as those of \(y\) increase by 1. For any term the sum of the exponents is \(n\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-61}{}  The coefficient of \(x^{n-k} y^k\) is \(\binom{n}{k}\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-62}{} The triangular array of binomial coefficients is called Pascal's triangle after the seventeenth-century French mathematician Blaise Pascal. Note that each number in the triangle other than the 1's at the ends of each row is the sum of the two numbers to the right and left of it in the row above.%
\end{enumerate}
%
\begin{theorem}[The Binomial Theorem]\label{binomial-theorem}
\index{The Binomial Theorem} If \(n \geq  0\), and \(x\) and \(y\) are numbers, then
\begin{equation*}(x+y)^{n} = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} x^{n-k} y^k\end{equation*}%
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}\hypertarget{proof-4}{}
This theorem will proven using a logical procedure called mathematical induction, which will be introduced in Chapter 3. %
\end{proof}
\begin{example}[Identifying a term in an expansion]\label{term-in-an-expansion}
Find the third term in the expansion of \(( x-y )^{4}\). The third term,  when \(k=2\), is \(\binom{4}{2} x^{4-2} y^2 = 6 x^2 y^2\).%
\end{example}
\begin{example}[A Binomial Expansion]\label{a-full-expansion}

Expand \((3 x - 2 )^{3}\).  If we replace \(x\)  and \(y\)  in the Binomial Theorem with \(3x\) and \(-2\), respectively, we get
\begin{equation*}\begin{split} 
\sum_{k=0}^3 \binom{3}{k} (3x)^{n-k} (-2)^k & = \binom{3}{0} (3x)^{3} (-2)^0 + \binom{3}{1} (3x)^{2} (-2)^1 + \binom{3}{2} (3x)^{1} (-2)^2 + \binom{3}{3} (3x)^{0} (-2)^3 \\
& = 27 x^3 - 54 x^2 + 36 x - 8 
\end{split}
\end{equation*}%
\end{example}

\index{Mathematica  Note!Bridge Hands}\emph{Mathematica}  has a built-in function for binomial coefficients, \(\texttt{Binomial}\). Unlike the examples we've concentrated on that can be done without technology, you can compute extremely large values. For 
example, a bridge hand is a 13 element subset of a standard 52 card deck. The order in which the cards come to the player doesn't matter. From the point of view of a single player, the number of possible bridge hands is \(\texttt{Binomial[52,13]}\), which is easily computed with \(Mathematica\) with an output of 635013559600%
\par
In bridge, the location of a hand in relation to the dealer has some bearing on the game. An even truer indication of the number of possible hands takes into account \(each\)  player's possible hand. It is customary 
to refer to bridge positions as West, North, East and South. We can apply the rule of product to get the total number of bridge hands with the following logic. West can get any of the \(\binom{52}{13}\) hands identified above. Then North get 13 of the remaining 39 cards and so has  \(\binom{39}{13}\) possible hands. East then gets 13 of the 26 remaining cards, which has \(\binom{26}{13}\)  possibilities. South gets the remaining cards. Therefore the number of bridge hands is computed by evaluating the expression \begin{equation*}\texttt{Binomial[52,13] Binomial[52,13] Binomial[52,13]}\end{equation*} which is equal to 53644737765488792839237440000%
