<div class="para">A Word Of Caution: Frequently we may can get “different-looking” answers to the same problem when a system has an infinite number of solutions. Assume the solutions set in this example is reported to be <span class="process-math">\(A = \left\{\left(1+16x_2, x_2, -11x_3\right) \mid x_3\in \mathbb{R}\right\}\text{.}\)</span> Certainly the result described by <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> looks different from that described by <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> To see whether they indeed describe the same set, we wish to determine whether every solution produced in <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> can be generated in <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> For example, the solution generated by <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> when <span class="process-math">\(x_3=11\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\((-15, -1, 11)\text{.}\)</span> The same triple can be produced by <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> by taking <span class="process-math">\(x_2= -1\text{.}\)</span> We must prove that every solution described in <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is described in <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and, conversely, that every solution described in <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is described in <span class="process-math">\(S\text{.}\)</span> (See Exercise 6 of this section.)</div>
