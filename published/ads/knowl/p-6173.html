<div class="para">We close this section with a brief discussion of isomorphic fields. Again, since a field is a ring, the definition of isomorphism of fields is the same as that of rings. It can be shown that if <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is a field isomorphism, then <span class="process-math">\(f\left(a^{-1} \right) = f(a)^{-1}\text{;}\)</span> that is, inverses are mapped onto inverses under any field isomorphism. A major question to try to solve is: How many different non-isomorphic finite fields are there of any given order? If <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> is a prime, it seems clear from our discussions that all fields of order <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> are isomorphic to <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}_p\text{.}\)</span> But how many nonisomorphic fields are there, if any, of order 4, 6, 8, 9, etc? The answer is given in the following theorem, whose proof is beyond the scope of this text.</div>
