<div class="para">Some comments on this example:</div>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">An equation of the form <span class="process-math">\(F_k = a F_{k-1} + b F_{k-2}\)</span> , where <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> are given constants, is  referred to as a linear homogeneous second-order difference equation. The conditions <span class="process-math">\(F_0=c_0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(F_1= c_1\)</span> , where <span class="process-math">\(c_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c_2\)</span> are constants, are called initial conditions. Those of you who are familiar with differential equations may recognize that this language parallels what is used in differential equations. Difference (aka recurrence) equations move forward discretely; that is, in a finite number of positive steps.  On the other hand,  a differential equation moves continuously; that is, takes an infinite number of infinitesimal steps.</div></li>
<li><div class="para logical">
<div class="para">A recurrence relationship of the form <span class="process-math">\(S_k = a S_{k-1} + b\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> are constants, is called a first-order difference equation. In order to write out the sequence, we need to know one initial condition.  Equations of this type can be solved similarly to the method outlined in the example by introducing the superfluous equation <span class="process-math">\(1 =0\cdot F_{k-1}+1\)</span> to obtain in matrix equation:</div>
