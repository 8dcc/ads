<div class="para">Out of necessity, integer addition with a computer is addition modulo <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> some larger number. Consider the case where <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is small, like 64. Then addition involves the addition of six-digit binary numbers. Consider the process of adding 31 and 1. Assume the computer’s adder takes as input two bit strings  <span class="process-math">\(a = \left\{a_0,a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_5\right\}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b=\left\{b_0,b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4,b_5\right\}\)</span> and outputs <span class="process-math">\(s = \left\{s_0,s_1,s_2,s_3,s_4,s_5\right\}\text{,}\)</span> the sum of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\text{.}\)</span> Then, if <span class="process-math">\(a = 31 = (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b = 1 = (1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> will be (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1), or 32. The output <span class="process-math">\(s_{ }=1\)</span> cannot be determined until all other outputs have been determined. If addition is done with a finite-state machine, as in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ex-binary-adder.html" title="Example 14.3.9: A Binary Adder">Example 14.3.9</a>, the time required to get <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> will be six time units, where one time unit is the time it takes to get one output from the machine.  In general, the time required to obtain <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> will be proportional to the number of bits.   Theoretically, this time can be decreased, but the explanation would require a long digression and our relative results would not change that much. We will use the rule that the number of time units needed to perform addition modulo <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is proportional to  <span class="process-math">\(\left\lceil \log_2n\right\rceil\text{.}\)</span>
