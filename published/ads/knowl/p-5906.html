<div class="para">When we look at groups like <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}_2{}^4\)</span> from a point of view, we refer to these sets as <dfn class="terminology">metric spaces</dfn> or simply <dfn class="terminology">spaces</dfn>.  In the case of <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}_2{}^4\text{,}\)</span> there are just <span class="process-math">\(2^4=16\)</span> points in the space and the maximum distance between the points is <span class="process-math">\(4\text{.}\)</span> More generally <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}_2{}^n\)</span> has <span class="process-math">\(2^n\)</span> points and the maximum distance between points in that space is <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span>  Looking at the group <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}_2{}^n\)</span> from this geometric point of view is essentially the same as the <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/def-n-cube.html" title="Definition 9.4.17: The n-cube"><span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>-cubeÂ 9.4.17</a> we considered in discussing Hamiltonian graphs.  In this section we will use <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>-tuples such as <span class="process-math">\((1,1,0,1)\)</span> interchangeably with strings of bits such as <span class="process-math">\(1101\text{.}\)</span>
