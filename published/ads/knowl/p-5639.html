<div class="para">What happens if you start at one of the unused tacks and again jump to every third tack? The two broken paths on <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-string-art-cosets.html" title="Figure 15.2.1">FigureÂ 15.2.1</a> show that identical squares are produced. The tacks are thus partitioned into very similar subsets. The subsets of <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}_{12}\)</span> that they correspond to are <span class="process-math">\(\{0,
3, 6, 9\}\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\{1, 4, 7, 10\}\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\{2, 5, 8, 11\}\text{.}\)</span> These subsets are called cosets. In particular, they are called cosets of the subgroup <span class="process-math">\(\{0, 3, 6, 9\}\text{.}\)</span> We will see that under certain conditions, cosets of a subgroup can form a group of their own. Before pursuing this example any further we will examine the general situation.</div>
