<div class="para">First the field must contain the additive and multiplicative identities, 0 and 1, so, without loss of generality, we can assume that the field we are looking for is of the form <span class="process-math">\(F = \{0, 1, a, b\}\text{.}\)</span>  Since there are only two nonisomorphic groups of order 4, we have only two choices for the group table for <span class="process-math">\([F; +]\text{.}\)</span>   If the additive group is isomorphic to <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}_4\)</span> then two of the nonzero elements of <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> would not be their own additive inverse (as are 1 and 3 in <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}_4\)</span>).   Letâ€™s assume <span class="process-math">\(\beta \in F\)</span> is one of those elements and <span class="process-math">\(\beta +\beta =\gamma \neq 0\text{.}\)</span>  An isomorphism between the additive groups <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> and  <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}_4\)</span> would require that <span class="process-math">\(\gamma\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span>  correspond with 2 in  <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}_4\text{.}\)</span>  We could continue our argument and infer that <span class="process-math">\(\gamma \cdot \gamma =0\text{,}\)</span> producing a zero divisor, which we need to avoid if <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> is to be a field.   We leave the remainder of the argument to the reader.   We can thus complete the addition table so that <span class="process-math">\([F;+]\)</span> is isomorphic to <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}_2{}^2\text{:}\)</span>
