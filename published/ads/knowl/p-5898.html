<div class="para">We will assume that our information is being sent along a <dfn class="terminology">binary symmetric channel</dfn>. By this, we mean that any single bit that is transmitted will be received improperly with a certain fixed probability, <span class="process-math">\(p\text{,}\)</span> independent of the bit value.   The magnitude of <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> is usually quite small. To illustrate the process, we will assume that <span class="process-math">\(p = 0.001\text{,}\)</span> which, in the real world, would be considered somewhat large. Since <span class="process-math">\(1 - p = 0.999\text{,}\)</span> we can expect <span class="process-math">\(99.9\%\)</span> of all bits to be properly received.</div>
