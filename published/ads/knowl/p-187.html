<div class="para">We embarked on this open-source project in 2010, twenty-one years after the publication of the 2nd edition of <em class="emphasis">Applied Discrete Structures for Computer Science</em> in 1989.   We had signed a contract for the second edition with Science Research Associates in 1988 but by the time the book was ready to print, SRA had been sold to MacMillan. Soon after, the rights had been passed on to Pearson Education, Inc. In 2010, the long-term future of printed textbooks was uncertain. In the meantime, textbook prices (both printed and e-books) had increased and a growing open source textbook movement had started. One of our objectives in revisiting this text is to make it available to our students in an affordable format. In its original form, the text was peer-reviewed and was adopted for use at several universities throughout the country. For this reason, we see <em class="emphasis">Applied Discrete Structures</em> as not only an inexpensive alternative, but a high quality alternative.</div>
