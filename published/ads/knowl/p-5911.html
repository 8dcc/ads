<div class="para">At the receiving end, the decoding function acts on the four-bit block <span class="process-math">\(b = \left(b_1,b _2 ,b_3,b_4 \right)\)</span> with the function  <span class="process-math">\(d: \mathbb{Z}_2{}^4\to \mathbb{Z}_2^4\text{,}\)</span> where</div>

<div class="para">Notice that the fourth bit of <span class="process-math">\(d(b)\)</span> is an indicator of whether there is a parity error - 0 if no error, and 1 if an error. If no parity error occurs, the first three bits are recorded as part of the message. If a parity error occurs, we will assume that a retransmission of that block can be requested. This request can take the form of automatically having the parity-check bit of <span class="process-math">\(d(b)\)</span> sent back to the source. If 1 is received, the previous block is retransmitted; if 0 is received, the next block is sent. This assumption of two-way communication is significant, but it is desirable to make this coding system useful. For our calculations, it is reasonable to expect that the probability of a transmission error in the opposite direction is also 0.001.  Without going into the details, we will report that the probability of success in sending 3000 bits is approximately 0.990 and the rate is approximately <span class="process-math">\(3/5\text{.}\)</span> The rate includes the transmission of the parity-check bit to the source and is only approximate because the resent blocks will decrease the rate below <span class="process-math">\(3/5\)</span> somewhat.</div>
