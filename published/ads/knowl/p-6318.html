<div class="para">Therefore, <span class="process-math">\(a + 1\)</span> is also a zero of <span class="process-math">\(x^2 + x + 1\text{.}\)</span> Hence, <span class="process-math">\(S = \{0, 1, a, a + 1\}\)</span> is the smallest field that contains <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}_2 = \{0, 1\}\)</span> as a subfield and contains all zeros of <span class="process-math">\(x^2 + x + 1\text{.}\)</span> This extension field is denoted by <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}_2(a)\text{.}\)</span> Note that <span class="process-math">\(x^2 + x + 1\)</span> splits in <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}_2(a)\text{;}\)</span> that is, it factors into linear factors in <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}_2(a)\text{.}\)</span> We also observe that <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}_2(a)\)</span> is a field containing exactly four elements. By <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/theorem-number-of-fields.html" title="Theorem 16.2.10">TheoremÂ 16.2.10</a>, we expected that <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}_2(a)\)</span> would be of order <span class="process-math">\(p^2\)</span> for some prime <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> and positive integer <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> Also recall that all fields of order <span class="process-math">\(p^n\)</span> are isomorphic. Hence, we have described all fields of order <span class="process-math">\(2^2 =4\)</span> by finding the extension field of a polynomial that is irreducible over <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}_2\text{.}\)</span>
