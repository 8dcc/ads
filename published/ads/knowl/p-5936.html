<div class="para">At a glance, we can see that this code will not correct most single bit errors. Suppose an error <span class="process-math">\(\vec{e}=(e_1,e_2,e_3,e_4,e_5)\)</span> is added in the transmission of the five bits. Specifically, suppose that 1 is added (mod 2) in position <span class="process-math">\(j\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(1 \leq j\leq 5\)</span> and the other coordinates of <span class="process-math">\(\vec{e}\)</span> are  0.  Then when we compute the syndrome of our received transmission, we see that</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\vec{c}H = (\vec{a}G + \vec{e})H  = (\vec{a}G)H + \vec{e}H = \vec{e}H.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">But <span class="process-math">\(\vec{e}H\)</span> is the <span class="process-math">\(j^{th}\)</span> row of <span class="process-math">\(H\text{.}\)</span>  If the syndrome is <span class="process-math">\((1,1)\)</span> we know that the error occurred in position 1 and we can correct it.  However, if the error is in any other position we canâ€™t pinpoint its location.  If the syndrome is <span class="process-math">\((1,0)\text{,}\)</span> then the error could have occurred in either position 2 or position 3.    This code does detect all single bit errors but only corrects one fifth of them.</div>
