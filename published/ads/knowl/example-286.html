<div class="para">Suppose we take each individual bit in our message and encode it by repeating it three times.  In other words, if <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> is a single bit, <span class="process-math">\(e(a)=(a,a,a)\text{.}\)</span> The code words for this code are <span class="process-math">\((0,0,0)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((1,1,1)\text{.}\)</span>  Let’s look at the geometry behind this code.  The message space has just two points, but the code space is <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}_2{}^3\text{,}\)</span> which has 8 points, the vertices of the <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span>-cube, which appears in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-triplecube.html" title="Figure 15.5.6">Figure 15.5.6</a>.</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 60%; margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;"><img src="external/images/fig-triplecube.png" class="contained" alt="The \(3\)-cube with code words displayed as circular vertices."></div>
<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">15.5.6<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>The <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span>-cube with code words displayed as circular vertices</figcaption></figure> <div class="para">In the figure for this code, the code words are circular vertices. If we identify the balls of radius 1 centered around the two code words, you might notice that the two balls do not intersect.  Each has a different vertex with triangular, square and pentagonal shapes.  From a geometric point of view, this is why we can correct a single bit error.  If any string of three bits in the code space is received it is in one of the two balls and the code word in that ball had to have been the one that was transmitted.</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Regarding the actual correction process, the shapes have a meaning, as outlined in the following list.</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">Circle:  No correction needed</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Pentagon: Correct the first bit</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Square: Correct the second bit</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Triangle: Correct the third bit</div></li>
</ul>
</div> <div class="para">Of course, once the correction is made, only the first bit is extracted from the code word since all bits will be equal. The simplicity of the final result masks an important property of all error correcting codes we consider. All of the possible points in the code space can be partitioned in such a way that each block in the partition corresponds with a specific correction that we can make to recover the correct code word.</div> <div class="para">If you have read about cosets, you will see that the partition we refer to is the set of left cosets of the set of code words.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s-coding-theory-groups.html#example-286" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
