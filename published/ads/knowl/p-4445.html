<div class="para">Order sequences are also useful in helping one find isomorphisms. Consider the group <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{U}_5\)</span> (the set <span class="process-math">\(\{1,2,3,4\}\)</span> with mod-5 multiplication). Its order sequence is <span class="process-math">\(1,2,4,4\text{,}\)</span> which suggests that it might be isomorphic to <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}_4\text{.}\)</span> In fact, any isomorphism <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}_4\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{U}_5\)</span> must map <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> (the only element of order 1 in <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}_4\)</span>) to <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> (the only element of order 1 in <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{U}_4\)</span>) and must map <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> (the only element of order 2 in <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}_4\)</span>) to <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span> (the only element of order 2 in <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{U}_4\)</span>). There are only two bijections <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}_4\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{U}_4\)</span> satisfying <span class="process-math">\(f(0) = 1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f(2) = 4\text{,}\)</span> so these are the only two candidate isomorphisms (and both candidates turn out to be true isomorphisms).</div>
