<div class="para">This topic is somewhat obscure. It doesn’t appear in most texts, but is a nice companion to degree sequences in graph theory.  Recall that every undirected graph has a degree sequence, and graphs with different <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/def-degree-sequence.html" title="Definition 9.1.31: Degree Sequence of a Graph">degree sequences 9.1.31</a> are not isomorphic. This is a convenient way to identify non-isomorphic graphs. We see below that order sequences play exactly the same role in identifying whether two finite groups are isomorphic.  Furthermore, identical order sequences of two finite groups give an excellent set of hints for constructing an isomorphism, if one such exists.  My colleague, Jim Propp, has been using this idea for a while in his classes and I “discovered” it later.   Neither of us can claim originality. Much of the following discussion is paraphrased from Jim’s notes.</div>
