<div class="para">Next we turn to division of polynomials, which is not an operation since the result is a pair of polynomials, not a single one. From high school algebra we all learned the standard procedure for dividing a polynomial <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> by a second polynomial <span class="process-math">\(g(x)\text{.}\)</span> This process of polynomial long division is referred to as the division property for polynomials. Under this scheme we continue to divide until the result is a quotient <span class="process-math">\(q(x)\)</span> and a remainder <span class="process-math">\(r(x)\)</span> whose degree is strictly less than that of the divisor <span class="process-math">\(g(x)\text{.}\)</span> This property is valid over any field. Before giving a formal description, we consider some examples.</div>
