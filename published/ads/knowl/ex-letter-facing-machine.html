</h4> <div class="para">An application of <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{D}_4\)</span> is in the design of a letter-facing machine.  Imagine letters entering a conveyor belt to be postmarked. They are placed on the conveyor belt at random so that two sides are parallel to the belt. Suppose that a postmarker can recognize a stamp in the top right corner of the envelope, on the side facing up. In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-letter-facer.html" title="Figure 15.3.29">FigureÂ 15.3.29</a>, a sequence of machines is shown that will recognize a stamp on any letter, no matter what position in which the letter starts. The letter <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> stands for a postmarker. The letters <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> stand for rotating and flipping machines that perform the motions of <span class="process-math">\(r_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f_1\text{.}\)</span>

<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">15.3.29<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>A letter facer</figcaption></figure> <div class="para">The arrows pointing up indicate that if a letter is postmarked, it is taken off the conveyor belt for delivery. If a letter reaches the end, it must not have a stamp. Letter-facing machines like this have been designed (see <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/biblio-gallian-1977.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 16: Group Theory and the Design of a Letter-Facing Machine">[16]</a>). One economic consideration is that <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span>-machines tend to cost more than <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span>-machines. <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span>-machines also tend to damage more letters. Taking these facts into consideration, the reader is invited to design a better letter-facing machine. Assume that <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span>-machines cost <span class="process-math">\(\$800\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span>-machines cost <span class="process-math">\(\$500\text{.}\)</span> Be sure that all corners of incoming letters will be examined as they go down the conveyor belt.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s-permutation-groups.html#ex-letter-facing-machine" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
