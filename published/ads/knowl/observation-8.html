<div class="para">This last example changes our course of action. If we had gotten a factor group from <span class="process-math">\(\left\{C_0,C_1,C_2\right\}\text{,}\)</span> we might have hoped to prove that every collection of left cosets forms a group. Now our question is: How can we determine whether we will get a factor group? Of course, this question is equivalent to: When is the induced operation well defined? There was only one step in the proof of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/theorem-coset-operation-well-defined.html" title="Theorem 15.2.18: Coset operation is well-defined (Abelian Case)">Theorem 15.2.18</a>, where we used the fact that <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> was abelian. We repeat the equations here:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/theorem-coset-operation-well-defined.html">
\begin{equation*}
a'*b' = \left(a*h_1\right)*\left(b*h_2 \right) = (a*b)*\left(h_1*h_2\right)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">since <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> was abelian.</div>
</div> <div class="para">The last step was made possible by the fact that <span class="process-math">\(h_1*b=b*h_1\text{.}\)</span> As the proof continued, we used the fact that <span class="process-math">\(h_1*h_2\)</span> was in <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> and so <span class="process-math">\(a'*b'\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\((a*b)*h\)</span> for some <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(H\text{.}\)</span> All that we really needed in the “abelian step” was that <span class="process-math">\(h_1*b = b*(\textrm{something in } H) = b*h_3\text{.}\)</span>  Then, since <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> is closed under <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span>’s operation, <span class="process-math">\(h_3*h_2\)</span> is an element of <span class="process-math">\(H\text{.}\)</span> The consequence of this observation is that we define a certain kind of subgroup that guarantees that the inducted operation is well-defined.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s-normal-subgroups-homomorphisms.html#observation-8" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
