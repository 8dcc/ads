<div class="para">Venn diagrams are named after the logician John Venn, who introduced them in a paper in 1880. In his paper, he acknowledged that they were not new. In fact he referred to them as Euler Circles, because the famous mathematician Leonhard Euler (pronounced Oy-ler) introduced them in the 1700’s.  Don’t feel bad for Euler though.  He has plenty of other things named after him, including some we see later in this book.</div>
