<div class="para">The last step was made possible by the fact that <span class="process-math">\(h_1*b=b*h_1\text{.}\)</span> As the proof continued, we used the fact that <span class="process-math">\(h_1*h_2\)</span> was in <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> and so <span class="process-math">\(a'*b'\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\((a*b)*h\)</span> for some <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(H\text{.}\)</span> All that we really needed in the “abelian step” was that <span class="process-math">\(h_1*b = b*(\textrm{something in } H) = b*h_3\text{.}\)</span>  Then, since <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> is closed under <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span>’s operation, <span class="process-math">\(h_3*h_2\)</span> is an element of <span class="process-math">\(H\text{.}\)</span> The consequence of this observation is that we define a certain kind of subgroup that guarantees that the inducted operation is well-defined.</div>
