<div class="para">In doing <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ex-another-diagonalization.html" title="Example 12.4.8: Diagonalization of a 3 by 3 matrix">Example 12.4.8</a>, the given <span class="process-math">\(3\times 3\)</span> matrix <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> produced only two, not three, distinct eigenvalues, yet we were still able to diagonalize <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> The reason we were able to do so was because we were able to find three linearly independent eigenvectors. Again, the main idea is to produce a matrix <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> that does the diagonalizing. If <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is an <span class="process-math">\(n \times  n\)</span> matrix, <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> will be an <span class="process-math">\(n\times
n\)</span> matrix, and its <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> columns must be linearly independent eigenvectors. The main question in the study of diagonalizability is “When can it be done?” This is summarized in the following theorem.</div>
