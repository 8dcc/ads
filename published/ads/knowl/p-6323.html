<div class="para">First, we start with the irreducible polynomial <span class="process-math">\(p(x)=x^3 + x + 1\)</span> over <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}_2\text{.}\)</span> There is another such cubic polynomial, but its choice produces essentially the same result.    Just as we did in the previous example, we assume we have a zero of <span class="process-math">\(p(x)\)</span> and call it  <span class="process-math">\(\beta\text{.}\)</span>  Since we have assumed that <span class="process-math">\(p(\beta)= \beta^3+\beta + 1=0\text{,}\)</span> we get the recurrence relation for powers <span class="process-math">\(\beta^3=\beta + 1\)</span> that lets us reduce the seven powers <span class="process-math">\(\beta^k\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(0 \leq k \leq 6\text{,}\)</span> to  linear combinations of 1, <span class="process-math">\(\beta\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\beta^2\text{.}\)</span> Higher powers will reduce to these seven, which make up the elements of a field with <span class="process-math">\(2^3=8\)</span> elements when we add zero to the set.   We leave as an exercise for you to set up a table relating powers of <span class="process-math">\(\beta\)</span> with the linear combinations.</div>
