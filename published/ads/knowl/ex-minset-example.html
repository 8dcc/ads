<div class="para">Consider the following example.

In place of <span class="process-math">\(B_1^c\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B_2^c\text{,}\)</span> let’s try <span class="process-math">\(B_1^c\cap B_2\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B_1\cap B_2^c\text{,}\)</span> respectively:</div> <figure class="table table-like"><figcaption><span class="type">Table</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">4.3.7<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span></figcaption><div class="tabular-box natural-width"><table class="tabular">

</table></div></figure> <div class="para">We have now produced the elements 1, 2, 3, and 5 using <span class="process-math">\(B_1\cap B_2\text{,}\)</span>  <span class="process-math">\(B_1^c\cap B_2\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B_1\cap B_2^c\)</span> yet we have not listed the elements 4 and 6. Most ways that we could combine <span class="process-math">\(B_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B_2\)</span> such as <span class="process-math">\(B_1\cup B_2\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(B_1\cup B_2^c\)</span> will produce duplications of listed elements and will not produce both 4 and 6. However we note that <span class="process-math">\(B_1^c\cap B_2^c= \{4, 6\}\text{,}\)</span> exactly the elements we need.</div> <div class="para">After more experimenting, we might reach a conclusion that each element of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> appears exactly once in one of the four minsets <span class="process-math">\(B_1\cap B_2\)</span> ,  <span class="process-math">\(B_1^c\cap B_2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(B_1\cap B_2^c\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B_1^c\cap B_2^c\text{.}\)</span> Hence, we have a partition of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> In fact this is the finest partition of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> in that all other partitions we could generate consist of selected unions of these minsets.</div> <div class="para">At this point, we might ask and be able to answer the question “How many different subsets of our universe can we generate from  <span class="process-math">\(B_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B_2\text{?}\)</span>”  The answer is <span class="process-math">\(2^{\textrm{number of nonempty minsets}}\text{,}\)</span> which is <span class="process-math">\(2^4=16\)</span> in this case.  Notice that in general, it would be impossible to find two sets from which we could generate all subsets of <span class="process-math">\(A=\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\)</span> since there will never be more than four nonempty minsets.   If we allowed ourselves three subsets and tried to generat all sets from them, then the number of minsets would be <span class="process-math">\(2^3 =8\text{.}\)</span>  With only six elements in <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> there could be six minsets, each containing a single element.  In that case we could generate the whole power set of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span>
