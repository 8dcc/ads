<div class="para">What is the operation on this set of symmetries?   We will call the operation “followed by” and use the symbol <span class="process-math">\(*\)</span>  to represent it.  The operation will be to combine motions, applying motions from right to left, as with functions.  We will illustrate how <span class="process-math">\(*\)</span> is computed by finding  <span class="process-math">\(r_1*f_1\text{.}\)</span>  Starting with the initial configuration, if you perform the <span class="process-math">\(f_1\)</span> motion, and then immediately perform <span class="process-math">\(r_1\)</span> on the result, we get the same configuration as if we just performed <span class="process-math">\(f_4\text{,}\)</span> which is to flip the square along the line <span class="process-math">\(l_4\text{.}\)</span>   Therefore, <span class="process-math">\(r_1*f_1 = f_4\text{.}\)</span>  An important observation is that <span class="process-math">\(f_1*r_1 \neq f_4\text{,}\)</span> meaning that this group is nonabelian. The reader is encouraged to verify this on their own.</div>
