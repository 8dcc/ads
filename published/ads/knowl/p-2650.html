<div class="para">Next, we consider a recursive algorithm for a binary search within a sorted list of items.  Suppose  <span class="process-math">\(r=\{r(1),r(2), \ldots  , r(n)\}\)</span> represent a list of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> items sorted by a numeric key in descending order. The <span class="process-math">\(j^{th}\)</span> item is denoted <span class="process-math">\(r(j)\)</span> and its key value by <span class="process-math">\(r(j).\texttt{key}\text{.}\)</span> For example, each item might contain data on the buildings in a city and the key value might be the height of the building. Then <span class="process-math">\(r(1)\)</span> would be the item for the tallest building and  <span class="process-math">\(r(1).\texttt{key}\)</span> would be its height. The algorithm <span class="process-math">\(\texttt{BinarySearch}(j, k)\)</span> can be applied to search for an item in <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> with key value <span class="process-math">\(C\text{.}\)</span> This would be accomplished by the execution of <span class="process-math">\(\texttt{BinarySearch}(1, n)\text{.}\)</span> When the algorithm is completed, the variable <span class="process-math">\(\texttt{Found}\)</span> will have a value of <span class="process-math">\(\texttt{true}\)</span> if an item with the desired key value was found, and the value of <span class="process-math">\(\textrm{location}\)</span> will be the index of an item whose key is <span class="process-math">\(C\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(\texttt{Found}\)</span> keeps the value <span class="process-math">\(\texttt{false}\text{,}\)</span> no such item exists in the list. The general idea behind the algorithm is illustrated in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-binsearch.html" title="Figure 8.1.6">FigureÂ 8.1.6</a>
