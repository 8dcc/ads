<div class="para">The arrows pointing up indicate that if a letter is postmarked, it is taken off the conveyor belt for delivery. If a letter reaches the end, it must not have a stamp. Letter-facing machines like this have been designed (see <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/biblio-gallian-1977.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 16: Group Theory and the Design of a Letter-Facing Machine">[16]</a>). One economic consideration is that <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span>-machines tend to cost more than <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span>-machines. <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span>-machines also tend to damage more letters. Taking these facts into consideration, the reader is invited to design a better letter-facing machine. Assume that <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span>-machines cost <span class="process-math">\(\$800\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span>-machines cost <span class="process-math">\(\$500\text{.}\)</span> Be sure that all corners of incoming letters will be examined as they go down the conveyor belt.</div>
