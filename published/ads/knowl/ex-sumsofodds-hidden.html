<div class="para">We will outline a proof that the sum of any two odd integers is even. Our first step will be to write the theorem in the familiar conditional form: If <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> are odd integers, then <span class="process-math">\(x+y\)</span> is even. The premise and conclusion of this theorem should be clear now. Notice that if <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> are not both odd, then the conclusion may or may not be true. Our only objective is to show that the truth of the premise forces the conclusion to be true. Therefore, we can express the integers <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> in the form that all odd integers take; that is:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
n \in  \mathbb{Z} \textrm{ is odd implies that } (\exists m\in \mathbb{Z}) (n = 2m + 1)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">This observation allows us to examine the sum  <span class="process-math">\(x+y\)</span> and to verify that it must be even.</div>
</div> <div class="para">One final important point: This example involves two odd integers that may or may not be equal.  If we use the fact that <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is odd and infer that <span class="process-math">\(x=2m+1\)</span> for some integer <span class="process-math">\(m\text{,}\)</span> we can do a similar thing with <span class="process-math">\(y\text{.}\)</span> However, in this context we cannot write <span class="process-math">\(y=2m+1\)</span> since we have already linked <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span>  We need to use a different variable, maybe <span class="process-math">\(q\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(m'\)</span> - any other symbol that is not already used in our discussion.</div></article></body>
