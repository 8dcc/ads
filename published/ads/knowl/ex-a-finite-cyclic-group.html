<span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}_{12} = [\mathbb{Z}_{12}; +_{12} ]\text{,}\)</span>  where <span class="process-math">\(+_{12}\)</span> is addition modulo 12, is a cyclic group. To verify this statement, all we need to do is demonstrate that some element of <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}_{12}\)</span>  is a generator. One such element is 5; that is, <span class="process-math">\(\langle 5 \rangle = \mathbb{Z}_{12}\text{.}\)</span> One more obvious generator is 1. In fact, 1 is a generator of every <span class="process-math">\([\mathbb{Z}_n; +_n]\text{.}\)</span> The reader is asked to prove that if an element is a generator, then its inverse is also a generator. Thus, <span class="process-math">\(-5 = 7\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(-1 = 11\)</span> are the other generators of <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}_{12}\text{.}\)</span> The remaining eight elements of the group are not generators.</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 70%; margin-left: 15%; margin-right: 15%;"><img src="external/images/fig-string-art.png" class="contained" alt="Examples of “string art”"></div>

<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-string-art.html" title="Figure 15.1.3">Figure 15.1.3</a>(a)  is an example of “string art” that illustrates how 5 generates <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}_{12}\text{.}\)</span> Twelve tacks are placed evenly around a circle and numbered 0 through 11. A string is tied to tack 0, and is then looped around every fifth tack. As a result, the numbers of the tacks that are reached are exactly the ordered multiples of 5 modulo 12: 5, 10, 3, ... , 7, 0.  Note that if every seventh tack were used, the same artwork would be produced. If every third tack were connected, as in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-string-art.html" title="Figure 15.1.3">Figure 15.1.3</a>(b), the resulting loop would only use four tacks; thus 3 does not generate <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}_{12}\text{.}\)</span>
