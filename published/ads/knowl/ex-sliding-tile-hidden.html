<body class="ignore-math"><article class="example example-like"> <div class="para">Consider the sliding-tile puzzles pictured in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-sliding-tile.html" title="Figure 15.3.21">Figure 15.3.21</a>. Each numbered square is a tile and the dark square is a gap. Any tile that is adjacent to the gap can slide into the gap. In most versions of this puzzle, the tiles are locked into a frame so that they can be moved only in the manner described above. The object of the puzzle is to arrange the tiles as they appear in Configuration (a).  Configurations (b) and (c) are typical starting points. We propose to show why the puzzle can be solved starting with (b), but not with (c).</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 70%; margin-left: 15%; margin-right: 15%;"><img src="external/images/fig-sliding-tile.png" class="contained" alt="Configurations of the sliding tile puzzle"></div>

<div class="para">We will associate a change in the configuration of the puzzle with an element of <span class="process-math">\(S_{16}\text{.}\)</span> Imagine that a tile numbered 16 fills in the gap. For any configuration of the puzzle, the identity <span class="process-math">\(i\text{,}\)</span> is the function that leave the configurate “as is.”   In general,  if <span class="process-math">\(f \in S_{16}\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(1 \leq  k \leq  16\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(f(k)\)</span> is the position to which  the tile in position <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> is moved by <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> that appears in the position of <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> in configuration (a). If we call the functions that, starting with configuration (a), result in configurations (b) and (c) by the names <span class="process-math">\(f_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f_2\text{,}\)</span> respectively,</div>

</div> <div class="para">How can we interpret the movement of one tile as a permutation?  Consider what happens when the 12 tile of <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> slides into the gap. The result is a configuration that we would interpret as <span class="process-math">\((12,16)\text{,}\)</span> a single transposition. Now if we slide the 8 tile into the 12 position, the result is or <span class="process-math">\((8, 16, 12)\text{.}\)</span> Hence, by “exchanging” the tiles 8 and 16, we have implemented the function <span class="process-math">\((8, 12) (12, 16) = (8, 12, 16)\text{.}\)</span>

Now observe that to start with initial configuration and terminate after a finite number of moves with the gap in its original position, you must make an even number of moves. Thus, configuration corresponding any permutation that leaves 16 fixed  cannot be solved if the permutation is odd.  Note that <span class="process-math">\(f_2\)</span> is an odd permutation; thus, Puzzle (c) can’t be solved. The proof that all even permutations, such as  <span class="process-math">\(f_1\text{,}\)</span> can be solved is left to the interested reader to pursue.</div></article></body>
