<li><div class="para">To read this truth table, you must realize that any one line represents a case: one possible set of values for <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(q\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The numbers 0 and 1 are used to denote false and true, respectively. This is consistent with the way that many programming languages treat logical, or Boolean, variables since a single bit, 0 or 1, can represent a truth value.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">For each case, the symbol under <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> represents the truth value of <span class="process-math">\(p\text{.}\)</span> The same is true for <span class="process-math">\(q\text{.}\)</span> The symbol under <span class="process-math">\(p \land q\)</span> represents its truth value for that case. For example, the second row of the truth table represents the case in which <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> is false, <span class="process-math">\(q\)</span> is true, and the resulting truth value for <span class="process-math">\(p \land q\)</span> is false. As in everyday speech, <span class="process-math">\(p \land q\)</span> is true only when both propositions are true.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Just as the letters <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> are frequently used in algebra to represent numeric variables, <span class="process-math">\(p\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(q\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> seem to be the most commonly used symbols for logical variables. When we say that <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> is a logical variable, we mean that any proposition can take the place of <span class="process-math">\(p\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">One final comment: The order in which we list the cases in a truth table is standardized in this book. If the truth table involves two simple propositions, the numbers under the simple propositions can be interpreted as the two-digit binary integers in increasing order, 00, 01, 10, and 11, for 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively.</div></li>
