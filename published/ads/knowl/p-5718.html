<div class="para">We will now consider the composition of permutations written in cyclic form by an example. Suppose that <span class="process-math">\(f
= (1,8, 3, 7)(4, 6)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(g = (1, 5, 6)(8, 3, 7, 4)\)</span> are elements of <span class="process-math">\(S_8\text{.}\)</span> To calculate <span class="process-math">\(f\circ g\text{,}\)</span> we start with simple concatenation:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/equation-cycle-composition-1.html">
\begin{gather}
f \circ g = (1,8, 3, 7)(4, 6)(1,5,6)(8, 3, 7,4)\tag{15.3.1}
\end{gather}
</div>
<div class="para">Although this is a valid expression for <span class="process-math">\(f \circ g\text{,}\)</span> our goal is to express the composition as a product of disjoint cycles as <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> were individually written. We will start by determining the cycle that contains 1.  When combining any number of cycles, they are always read from right to left, as with all functions. The first cycle  in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/equation-cycle-composition-1.html" title="Equation 15.3.1">(15.3.1)</a> does not contain 1; thus we move on to the second. The image of 1 under that cycle is 5. Now we move on to the next cycle, looking for 5, which doesnâ€™t appear. The fourth cycle does not contain a 5 either; so <span class="process-math">\(f\circ g(1) = 5\text{.}\)</span>
