<div class="para">Before we summarize the main results suggested by the previous examples, we should probably consider what could have happened if we had  attempted to perform divisions of polynomials in the ring <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}[x]\)</span> rather than in the polynomials over the field <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}_2\text{.}\)</span> For example, <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = x^2 - 1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(g(x)
= 2x - 1\)</span> are  both elements of the ring <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}[x]\text{,}\)</span> yet <span class="process-math">\(x^2-1=(\frac{1}{2} x+\frac{1}{2})(2x-1)-\frac{3}{4}\)</span> The quotient and remainder are not a polynomials over <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span> but polynomials over the field of rational numbers. For this reason it would be wise to describe all results over a field <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> rather than over an arbitrary ring <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> so that we donâ€™t have to expand our possible set of coefficients.</div>
