<div class="para">At this point, we might ask and be able to answer the question “How many different subsets of our universe can we generate from  <span class="process-math">\(B_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B_2\text{?}\)</span>”  The answer is <span class="process-math">\(2^{\textrm{number of nonempty minsets}}\text{,}\)</span> which is <span class="process-math">\(2^4=16\)</span> in this case.  Notice that in general, it would be impossible to find two sets from which we could generate all subsets of <span class="process-math">\(A=\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\)</span> since there will never be more than four nonempty minsets.   If we allowed ourselves three subsets and tried to generat all sets from them, then the number of minsets would be <span class="process-math">\(2^3 =8\text{.}\)</span>  With only six elements in <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> there could be six minsets, each containing a single element.  In that case we could generate the whole power set of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span>
