<div class="para">The graph of a linear equation in three-dimensional space is a plane. So geometrically we can visualize the three linear equations as three planes in three-space. Certainly the three planes can intersect in a unique point, as in the first example, or two of the planes could be parallel. If two planes are parallel, there are no common points of intersection; that is, there are no triple of real numbers that will satisfy all three equations. Another possibility is that the three planes could intersect along a common axis or line. In this case, there would be an infinite number of real number triples in <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R}^3\text{.}\)</span> Yet another possibility would be if the first two planes intersect in a line, but the line is parallel to, but not on, the third plane, giving us no solution.  Finally if all three equations describe the same plane, the solution set would be that plane.</div>
