<div class="para">One way to see that any two distinct code words have a distance from one another of at least 3 is to consider the images of any two distinct messages.  If <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> are distinct elements of <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}_2{}^3\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(c = a + b\)</span> has at least one coordinate equal to 1. Now consider the difference between <span class="process-math">\(e(a)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(e(b)\text{:}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
e(a) + e(b) &amp;= e(a + b) \\
&amp; = e(c)\\
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">Whether <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> has 1, 2, or 3 ones, <span class="process-math">\(e(c)\)</span> must have at least three ones.  This can be seen by considering the three cases separately.  For example, if <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> has a single one, two of the parity bits are also 1.  Therefore, <span class="process-math">\(e(a)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(e(b)\)</span> differ in at least three bits. By the same logic as with triple repetition, a single bit error in any code word produces an element of the code space that is contained in on of the balls of radius 1 centered about a code word.</div>
