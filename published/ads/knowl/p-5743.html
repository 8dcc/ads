<div class="para">By now weâ€™ve seen several instances where a group can appear through an isomorphic copy of itself in various settings.  The simplest such example is the cyclic group of order 2.   When this group is mentioned, we might naturally think of the group <span class="process-math">\(\left[\mathbb{Z}_2;+_2\right]\text{,}\)</span> but the groups <span class="process-math">\([\{-1,1\};\cdot ]\)</span>  and <span class="process-math">\(\left[S_2;\circ \right]\)</span> are isomorphic to it.  None of these groups are necessarily more natural or important than the others.  Which one you use depends on the situation you are in and all are referred to as <dfn class="terminology">realizations</dfn>  of the cyclic group of order 2.   The next family of groups we will study, the dihedral groups, has two natural realizations, first as permutations and second as geometric symmetries.</div>
