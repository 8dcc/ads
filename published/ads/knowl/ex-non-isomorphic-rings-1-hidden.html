<div class="para">Consider the rings <span class="process-math">\([\mathbb{Z}; +, \cdot ]\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\([2\mathbb{Z}; +, \cdot ]\text{.}\)</span> In Chapter 11 we showed that as groups, the two sets <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span> and 2<span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span> with addition were isomorphic. The group isomorphism that proved this was the function <span class="process-math">\(f : \mathbb{Z} \to 2\mathbb{Z}\text{,}\)</span> defined by <span class="process-math">\(f(n) = 2n\text{.}\)</span>  Is <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> a ring isomorphism? We need only check whether <span class="process-math">\(f(m\cdot n) = f(m)\cdot f(n)\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(m, n \in \mathbb{Z}\text{.}\)</span>  In fact, this condition is not satisfied:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
f(m\cdot n) = 2\cdot m\cdot n \quad\textrm{ and }\quad
f(m)\cdot f(n)=2m\cdot 2n= 4\cdot m \cdot n
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">Therefore,  <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is not a ring isomorphism. This does not necessarily mean that the two rings <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span> and 2<span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span> are not isomorphic, but simply that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> doesn’t satisfy the conditions.  We could imagine that some other function does. We could  try to find another function that is a ring isomorphism, or we could try to show that <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span> and 2<span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span> are not isomorphic as rings. To do the latter, we must find something different about the ring structure of <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span> and 2<span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}\text{.}\)</span>

</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">We already know that they behave identically under addition, so if they are different as rings, it must have something to do with how they behave under the operation of multiplication. Let’s begin to develop a checklist of how the two rings could differ:</div>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">Do they have the same cardinality? Yes, they are both countable.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Are they both commutative? Yes.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Are they both rings with unity? No.</div></li>
</ol>
<div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span> is a ring with unity, namely the number 1.   2<span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span> is not a ring with unity, <span class="process-math">\(1\notin 2\mathbb{Z}\text{.}\)</span>  Hence, they are not isomorphic as rings.</div>
