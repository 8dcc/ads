<div class="para">Imagine a situation in which information is being transmitted between two points. The information takes the form of high and low pulses (for example, radio waves or electric currents), which we will label 1 and 0, respectively.  As these pulses are sent and received, they are grouped together in blocks of fixed length.   The length determines how much information can be contained in one block.  If the length is <span class="process-math">\(r\text{,}\)</span> there are <span class="process-math">\(2^r\)</span> different values that a block can have. If the information being sent takes the form of text, each block might be a character. In that case, the length of a block may be seven, so that <span class="process-math">\(2^7 = 128\)</span> block values can represent letters (both upper and lower case), digits, punctuation, and so on.  During the transmission of data, noise can alter the signal so that what is received differs from what is sent. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-noise.html" title="Figure 15.5.1">FigureÂ 15.5.1</a> illustrates the problem that can be encountered if information is transmitted between two points.</div>
