<div class="para">Another universal concept that applies to the theory of rings is that of a subsystem. A subring of a ring <span class="process-math">\([R; +, \cdot ]\)</span> is any nonempty subset <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> that is a ring under the operations of <span class="process-math">\(R\text{.}\)</span> First, for <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> to be a subring of the ring <span class="process-math">\(R\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> must be a subgroup of the group <span class="process-math">\([R; +]\text{.}\)</span> Also, <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> must be closed under <span class="process-math">\(\cdot\text{,}\)</span> satisfy the associative law under <span class="process-math">\(\cdot\text{,}\)</span> and satisfy the distributive laws. But since <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> is a ring, the associative and distributive laws are true for every element in <span class="process-math">\(R\text{,}\)</span> and, in particular, for all elements in <span class="process-math">\(S\text{,}\)</span> since <span class="process-math">\(S\subseteq R\text{.}\)</span> We have just proven the following theorem:</div>
