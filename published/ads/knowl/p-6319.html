<div class="para">The reader might feel somewhat uncomfortable with the results obtained in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ex-extension-of-z2.html" title="Example 16.4.2: Extending \mathbb{Z}_2">Example 16.4.2</a>. In particular, what is <span class="process-math">\(a\text{?}\)</span> Can we describe it through a known quantity? All we know about <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> is that it is a zero of <span class="process-math">\(g(x)\)</span> and that <span class="process-math">\(a^2= a + 1\text{.}\)</span> We could also say that <span class="process-math">\(a(a + 1) = 1\text{,}\)</span> but we really expected more. However, should we expect more? In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ex-irreducible-over-Q-again.html" title="Example 16.4.1: Extending the Rational Numbers">Example 16.4.1</a>, <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> is a number we are more comfortable with, but all we really know about it is that <span class="process-math">\(\alpha =\sqrt{2}\)</span> is the number such that <span class="process-math">\(\alpha ^2= 2\text{.}\)</span> Similarly, the zero that the reader will obtain in Exercise 2 of this section is the imaginary number <span class="process-math">\(i\text{.}\)</span> Here again, this is simply a symbol, and all we know about it is that <span class="process-math">\(i^2=-1\text{.}\)</span> Hence, the result obtained in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ex-extension-of-z2.html" title="Example 16.4.2: Extending \mathbb{Z}_2">Example 16.4.2</a> is not really that strange.</div>
