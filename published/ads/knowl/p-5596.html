<div class="para">Addition in <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> can be done in parallel so that each new subtotal in the form of the triple <span class="process-math">\((s_1,s_2, s_3)\)</span>  takes only as long to compute as it takes to add in the largest modulus, <span class="process-math">\(\log _232=5\)</span> time units, if calculations are done in parallel. By the time rule that we have established, the addition of 20 numbers can be done in <span class="process-math">\(20\cdot 5= 100\)</span> time units, as opposed to <span class="process-math">\(20\cdot 15 =300\)</span> time units if we do the calculations in <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}_{21600}\text{.}\)</span>  However the result is a triple in <span class="process-math">\(G\text{.}\)</span>  The function that performs the inverse of <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">theta</code> is built into most mathematics programs, including Sage.  In Sage the function is <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">crt</code>, short for Chinese Remainder Theorem, the other common name of Sun Tzu’s Theorem.  We use this function to compute the inverse of our triple, which is an element of <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}_{21600}\text{.}\)</span>   The result isn’t the true sum because the modulus 21600 is not large enough.  However, we verify that our result is congruent to the true sum modulo 21600.</div>
