<div class="para">As the example above illustrates, <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/theorem-basic-group-properties.html" title="Theorem 16.1.18: Some Basic Properties">Theorem 16.1.18</a> is a modest beginning in the study of which algebraic manipulations are possible when working with rings. A fact in elementary algebra that is used frequently in problem solving is the cancellation law. We know that the cancellation laws are true under addition for any ring, based on group theory. Are the cancellation laws true under multiplication, where the group axioms can’t be counted on? More specifically, let <span class="process-math">\([R; +, \cdot ]\)</span> be a ring and let <span class="process-math">\(a, b, c\in R\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(a \neq 0\text{.}\)</span> When can we cancel the <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>’s in the equation <span class="process-math">\(a \cdot  b = a \cdot  c\text{?}\)</span> We can  do so if <span class="process-math">\(a^{-1}\)</span> exists, but we cannot assume that <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> has a multiplicative inverse. The answer to this question is found with the following definition and the theorem that follows.</div>
