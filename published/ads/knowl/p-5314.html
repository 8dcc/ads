<div class="para">At first glance, the two topics that we will discuss in this chapter seem totally unrelated. The first is monoid theory, which we touched upon in Chapter 11. The second is automata theory, in which computers and other machines are described in abstract terms. After short independent discussions of these topics, we will describe how the two are related in the sense that each monoid can be viewed as a machine and each machine has a monoid associated with it.</div>
