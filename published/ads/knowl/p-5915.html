<div class="para">In the figure for this code, the code words are circular vertices. If we identify the balls of radius 1 centered around the two code words, you might notice that the two balls do not intersect.  Each has a different vertex with triangular, square and pentagonal shapes.  From a geometric point of view, this is why we can correct a single bit error.  If any string of three bits in the code space is received it is in one of the two balls and the code word in that ball had to have been the one that was transmitted.</div>
