<div class="para">Consider the rings <span class="process-math">\([\mathbb{Z}; +, \cdot ]\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\([2\mathbb{Z}; +, \cdot ]\text{.}\)</span> In Chapter 11 we showed that as groups, the two sets <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span> and 2<span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span> with addition were isomorphic. The group isomorphism that proved this was the function <span class="process-math">\(f : \mathbb{Z} \to 2\mathbb{Z}\text{,}\)</span> defined by <span class="process-math">\(f(n) = 2n\text{.}\)</span>  Is <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> a ring isomorphism? We need only check whether <span class="process-math">\(f(m\cdot n) = f(m)\cdot f(n)\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(m, n \in \mathbb{Z}\text{.}\)</span>  In fact, this condition is not satisfied:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
f(m\cdot n) = 2\cdot m\cdot n \quad\textrm{ and }\quad
f(m)\cdot f(n)=2m\cdot 2n= 4\cdot m \cdot n
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">Therefore,  <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is not a ring isomorphism. This does not necessarily mean that the two rings <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span> and 2<span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span> are not isomorphic, but simply that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> doesnâ€™t satisfy the conditions.  We could imagine that some other function does. We could  try to find another function that is a ring isomorphism, or we could try to show that <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span> and 2<span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span> are not isomorphic as rings. To do the latter, we must find something different about the ring structure of <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span> and 2<span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}\text{.}\)</span>
