<div class="para">The current computing landscape is very different from the 1980’s and this accounts for the most significant changes in the text. One of the most common programming languages of the 1980’s was Pascal.  We used it to illustrate many of the concepts in the text.  Although it isn’t totally dead, Pascal is far from the mainstream of computing in the 21st century.  The open source software movement was just starting in the late 1980’s and in 2005, the first version of Sage (later renamed SageMath), an open-source computer algebra system, was first released. In Applied Discrete Structures we have replaced "Pascal Notes" with "SageMath Notes."</div>
