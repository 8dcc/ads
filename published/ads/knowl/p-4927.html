<div class="para">When solving systems of equations with mod 2 arithmetic, the elementary row operations are still fundamental.  However, since there is only one nonzero element, 1, you never need to multiply a row by a nonzero constant.   One other big difference is that the number of possible solutions is always finite.  If you have <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> linear equations in <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> unknowns, each unknown can only take on one of two values, 0 or 1.   Therefore there are only <span class="process-math">\(2^n\)</span> possible <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>-tuples to from which to draw a solution set.   Assuming <span class="process-math">\(m \leq n\text{,}\)</span> you typically (but not always) will have <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> basic variables after row-reduction and <span class="process-math">\(n-m\)</span> free variable.  If this is the case, and any solution exists, there will be <span class="process-math">\(2^{n-m}\)</span> different solutions.</div>
