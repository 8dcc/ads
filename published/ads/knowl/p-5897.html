<dfn class="terminology">Noise</dfn> is a fact of life for anyone who tries to transmit information.  Fortunately, in most situations we could expect a high percentage of the pulses that are sent to be received properly. However, when large numbers of pulses are transmitted, there are usually some errors due to noise. For the remainder of the discussion, we will make assumptions about the nature of the noise and the message that we want to send. Henceforth, we will refer to the pulses as bits.</div>
