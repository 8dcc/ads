<p>The sophomore computer science majors were told they must take one and only one of the following courses, Cryptography, Data Structures, or Javascript, in a given semester. The numbers in each course, respectively, for sophomore CS majors, were 75, 60, 55. How many sophomore C.S. majors are there? The Law of Addition applies here. There are exactly \(75 + 60 + 55 = 190\) CS majors since the rosters of the three courses listed above would be a partition of the CS majors.</p></article><div class="context-link" style="text-align:right;"><a href="Partitions-and-Law-of-Addition.html#student-counting-disjoint">(in-context)</a></div>
