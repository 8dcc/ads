</h5>
<p>A club has eight members eligible to serve as president, vice-president, and treasurer. How many ways are there of choosing these officers?
</p>
<p>
 Solution 1: Using the rule of products. There are eight possible choices for the presidency, seven for the vice-presidency, and six for the office of treasurer. By the rule of products there are \(8 \cdot 7\cdot 6 = 336\) ways of choosing these officers.
</p>
<p>
 Solution 2: Using the permutation formula. We want the total number of permutations of eight objects taken three at a time:
